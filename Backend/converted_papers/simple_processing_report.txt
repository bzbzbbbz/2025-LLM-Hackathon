This evolution of Ni species upon delithiation matches that expected from disproportionation. 41 At 4.8 V, the spectrum closely matches Ni L3-edge simulations of Ni 4+ (ESI, † Fig. S6) with 4-5% Ni 2+ . This is consistent with the excess Ni detected with ICP-OES occupying Li sites, as similarly sized Ni 2+ , and thus preventing all sites reaching Ni 4+ . 26,48 The bulk sensitivity of XRS suppresses contributions from surface layers which are otherwise seen even for inverse partial fluorescence yield (IPFY) measurements (ESI, † Fig. S7), including for reference Ni 4+ compounds. 49,50 Importantly this shows that charge compensation in the LiNiO2, licates the instability of delithiated LiNiO2, LiCoO2, NiO, ling the Evolution of LiCoO2, line and 50% edge height positions relative to pristine LiNiO2, ling range, lowering the electron density on O sites, but without a significant role for molecular O2, Coo, LiNi x Co(1 /C0 x )/2 Mn(1 /C0 x )/2O2, limited insight into the depth over which it is distributed.

The Mn -O distance decreases continuously from the beginning of the charge to high voltage and then reversibly increases in discharge, recovering its initial value. The total variation of the Mn -O distance over the potential window is small (0.01 Å). As shown in Figure 13a, similar changes occur during the second cycle, but again smaller than those observed for Ni and Co ions.

It has, for example, been applied to X-ray absorption and Raman spectroscopy. Hetero-spectral correlation has become one of the most active areas of research in 2D correlation spectroscopy. A positive cross peak in the synchronous 2D hetero-spectral correlation spectrum means that the two bands (Raman and XAS bands in this study) sharing a cross peak have the same origin, while a negative cross peak means that the two bands have different origins. Thus, the positive cross peak at (856.9 eV, 585 cm -1 ) and (856.9eV, 627cm -1 ) indicate that the peaks at 856.9eV in the XAS spectra and Raman band at 585cm -1 arise from the same origin. However, the negative cross peaks related to 856.9eV in the XAS spectra should be assigned to different Raman band at 517cm -1 . As shown in the 1D Raman and Ni LII,III-edge XAS spectra, the intensities of the three bands at 585 cm -1 , 627cm -1 , and 856.9eV are decreased during the charge process. It means that a Raman band at 585 and 517cm -1 are relative to peaks for Ni 2+ ion and Ni 3+ ion in XAS spectra, respectively.

   Reference Compounds: LiNi0.33Mn0.33Co0.33O2, limited by the quantity of Mn. 2 Since Ni is the main contributor to the capacity, e /uniFB00 orts to increase its content have been extensively pursued. Additionally, limiting Co content has been a focus to reduce the cost of NMC materials, facilitating EV market adoption. 3 LiNi1 -x -y Mn x Co y O2, LiNi x Co y Al z O2, LiNi1 -x -y Mn x Co y O2, nio, coo, LiNixMnyCozO2, LiNi x Mn y Co z O2, LiCoO2, lin, Y. Understanding the Overlithiation Properties of LiNi 0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2, liminary /uniFB01 ts, the amplitude reduction factor ( S 0 2 ) for each edge was determined and held constant throughout /uniFB01 tting (0.79 for Ni, 0.83 for Co, and 0.81 for Mn), in a similar manner as previous reports. 40 -44 The coordination numbers (CNs) were set to the crystallographic values to allow the decoupling of Debye -Waller disorder factors ( σ 2 ). 41,42,45,46 Two scattering paths were used to model Co and Mn K-edges, which include M -O and M -M. Unlike Co and Mn, the higher concentration of Ni in the electrode and its higher edge energy allowed for /uniFB01 tting of higher interatomic distances due to the enhanced data quality. Thus, the expanded model captures four scattering paths that include M -O and M -M as well as the scattering paths relating to the atoms in the adjacent interlayers and intralayer, M -M (denoted as M -M2) and M -M -M (denoted as M -M3). 41 Fitting ranges for k were 3.4 -14.0, 3.0 -10.0, and 3.0 -10.5 Å -1 for Ni, Co, and Mn, respectively. The r ranges were 1 -3 Å for Co and Mn while 1 -5.7 Å was used for Ni to encompass four coordination shells.

XAS investigations of NMC622 are limited to only a few reports containing ex situ measurements. 27 -30 In addition, the literature lacks reports utilizing operando XAS to probe NMC622 and most other compositions. The advantage of operando measurements, instead of ex situ , includes studying a battery during operation allowing the ability to capture phenomena that may only be kinetically accessible. To the best of our knowledge only one study has reported on operando XAS of Ni-rich NMC. 31 This report collected operando XAS on NMC811 during the /uniFB01 rst charge but o /uniFB00 ered limited discussion on the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra and extended X-ray absorption /uniFB01 ne structure (EXAFS) data were not included.

How the Negative Electrode Influences Interfacial and Electrochemical Properties of LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2, LiNiO2, LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2, line 8-ID, Inner Shell Spectroscopy, at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Cells were (dis)charged at a rate of C/5 for one full cycle between 3.0 and 4.3 V. The fresh cell underwent one charge and discharge step. The formation and cycled cells were charged to 4.3 V, and measurements were collected during the subsequent discharge and charge processes. Ni, Co, and Mn K-edges were collected in transmission mode in succession with reference foils measured concurrently for calibration to 8333, 7709, and 6539 eV, respectively. Scans at each absorption edge were collected in 4 min intervals using randomized measurement positions within the electrode area. This type of measurement protocol was used to minimize beam damage in the cell and obtain representative data across the cell although it does lead to minor XAS data variability because of the reaction heterogeneity that can exist across an entire electrode. Athena software was used to process the raw spectra and evaluate the valence of Co and Mn by linear combination /uniFB01 tting (LCF). 34 The selected energy range for LCF included -20 eV below to 30 eV above the edge energy for the least squares /uniFB01 tting of normalized μ ( E ) spectra. The edge energy is de /uniFB01 ned as the maximum of the /uniFB01 rst derivative of μ ( E ). This method allows the fraction of components, that contribute to the spectrum, to be determined, using known references. 35 In this case, the TM valence could be accurately evaluated by using appropriate standards where the TM exists in chemically similar environments to the NMC material. 36,37 The following standards were used during the valence determination for Co and Mn: LiCoO2, LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2, Lin, Y.; Xu, K.; Amine, K.; Pan, F.

   Reference Compounds: LiMn2O4 references in Fig. S8. At the Mn K -edge, the first identified component, the gray curve, corresponds to the pristine state, while the other two components are needed to describe the spectral evolution as a function of delithiation in both Co00 and Co08 electrodes. The second component (red curve) could resemble the Mn spinel phase, which is known to form in Co08 along the first charge 28 , but its spectral shape shows significant differences with respect to the LiMn2O4 reference, making this assignment not straightforward. Moreover, by looking to the evolution of the MCR components weight as a function of the Li content  (Fig.  2b,c)  it  seems  that  Co08  contains  a  significant  amount  (20%)  of  the  second component already at the pristine state, which becomes the major one (70%) in the charged state. Previous studies based on EXAFS fits on the same material quantified the formation of the spinel phase  up  to  only  10%  during  the  first  charge 28 .  It  is  possible  that  this  second  component corresponds  to  the  overlapping  contribution  of  the  spinel  formation  and  some  structural  stack changes. Indeed, similarly to the LiCoO2, line fit to the pre-edge  subtracted  absorption  spectra  to  extract  the  extended  X-ray  absorption  fine  structure (EXAFS) signal 39 . Prior to this, the data were calibrated, normalized and deglitched using the inhouse developed software named FDA. The Mn, Ni, and Co phases evolution have been monitored on the XANES  spectra applying multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) unmixing, using the MCR toolbox 40, 41 . The EXAFS signals were fitted using original code exploiting the xraylarch python library 42 . The coordination number, Debye-Waller parameter and interatomic distances were obtained for fitting with MnO2, LiCoO2, limited number of isolated particles, it seems that the spinel formation is happening at the particle surface in the Co-free material, an effect that we were not able to observe for Co08, where the spinel rather seems to form in the bulk of the particles 28-29 . This, together with a detected global reduced spinel formation in Co00 when compared with Co08, is in agreement with the proposition that Co favors fast kinetics of  TM migration along the charge process 32 . In particular, the TXM data suggest a possibly reduced Mn migration in the Co-free material. Comparing the herein reported results for Li1.2Mn0.56Ni0.16Co00.08O2, ling (0.5-0.1 eV). The energy resolution was determined at  the  nitrogen K -edge  measuring  the  visibility  of  nitrogen  gas  peaks  at  the  exit  slit  of  the monochromator following the strategy proposed in ref. 44 . The energy resolution at the Mn L3 -edge was extrapolated to be around 0.5 eV (full width at half maximum). A preliminary calibration of the absolute value of the energy was carefully performed before the experiment using standard references samples at different energies along the available energy range of the beamline (CaCO3, N2, TiO2, line) corresponding to the pristine state (Co 3+ ), a second one (red line)  to variations in the stacking arrangements 45 , and a third one (blue line) to the charged state (Co 4+ ). The pristine component is almost fully converted on the ones representing the charged state with a  behavior  correlating  with  the  Mn K -edge  components  detected  on  the  same  cathode. Interestingly, at the end of the charge process, the oxidized component is decreasing in favor of the  second  one,  suggesting,  as  at  the  Mn K -edge,  local  interlayer  structural  rearrangements occurring in Co08 above 240 mAh g -1 , most likely corresponding to the O2, NiO, LiNi 1-x-y CoxMnyO2, limited  to  around  140-160  mAh  g -1 6 , while relatively  high  costs  are  related  to  the  critical  cobalt 7,  8 .  To  go  beyond  this  limit,  chemical substitutions  at  the  Co  sites  have  been  explored,  enhancing  the  maximum  energy  density  and decreasing at the same time the production costs and safety hazards. In particular, the Co 3+ partial substitution by Mn 4+ , Ni 2+ , and Li + ions, enhances the electrochemical properties, resulting in a new  layered  cathode  material  called  "Li-rich  NMC".  This  approach  combines  the  different properties and effects of Ni, Co and Mn with the possibility of storing additional Li in the TM layers, showing capacities exceeding 280 mAh g -1 9 , i.e., much higher than that of conventional LiCoO2, LiNi 1/3 Mn1/3Co1/3 O2, nio, coo, CoO, LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2, limited,  and  the  individual  role  of  TMs  is  still  not  fully understood.

The NCA-Mg after the electrochemical cycling was employed as the sample at SOC 0% for the X-ray spectroscopic measurements. For the preparation of charged NCA-Mg samples, galvanostatic charging was subsequently performed at a current density of 0.1 mA cm GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 2 ( ca. 0.1 C) up to 3.8 V (for SOC 50%) and 4.2 V vs. Li þ /Li (for SOC 100%). These potentials are based on a charge-discharge curve. The galvanostatic charging was followed by potentiostatic charging at each PE potential for 1 h to make sure that the samples for the X-ray spectroscopic measurements became at SOCs of 50 and 100%, respectively. The reason for SOC � 100% was that there were several papers already published regarding the Ni L2,3-edge XAS studies of Ni oxidation state in LiNiO2, licability  of  these  hard  X-ray  spectroscopic methods to understand the CC behavior of Ni in the LiNiO2, licabilities of hard X-ray spectroscopic methods to understand the charge-compensation (CC)  behaviors  of  Ni  in  a  LiNiO2, lines measured by the Ni 1s2p RXES certainly reflect the PDOS of the unoccupied Ni 3d orbital, similarly to the spectral features in L2,3-edge XA spectra and K pre-edge features (see details in Supplementary data). In addition, it suggests that the RXE spectral features could also be utilized to understand the CC behavior of Ni in the LiNiO2, licability of Ni K pre-edge HERFD-XAS and Ni 1s2p RXES using hard X-ray for qualitative understanding of the CC behaviors of Ni in the NCA-Mg PE material for LIB enclosed in a sealed pouch. This work demonstrates that both of the hard X-ray spectroscopic methods can detect similar sequential changes in spectral features to soft X-ray Ni L2,3-edge XAS, which are related to unoccupied Ni 3d state and the oxidation state of Ni, with the change in SOC of the PE material. In this sense, Ni K pre-edge HERFD-XAS and Ni 1s2p RXES can become alternative methods to soft X-ray Ni L2,3-edge XAS with the advantage of high penetrating capability of hard X-ray to understand the CC behaviors  of  Ni  in  the  LiNiO2, LiNiO2, line,  respectively.  Overall,  the  final  state  of  Ni  1s2p  RXES would be almost the same as that of Ni L2,3-edge XAS in the range of Ni oxidation number from metallic Ni 0 (3d 8 [(t2g) 6 (eg) 2 ] 4s 2 ) to tetravalent Ni 4 þ (3d 6 [(t2g) 6 ]) as long as the Ni 1s core electron could be excited to the unoccupied Ni 3d orbital with the eg  symmetry and the electronic interactions and angular momentum couplings associated with the Ni 2p orbital could be neglected in the intermediate state.

   Reference Compounds: LII,III-edge XANES spectra. This is believed to result from the substitution of Mn by Ni and its hybridization with the peroxo-/superoxo-like species. It should be noted that this hybridization is with activated oxygen species and not the diminished initial hybridization observed on the surface. Recently, for the lithium-rich material Li 2 -x Ru 0.5Mn0.5O3, Sathiya et al. 3,33 described the preferential hybridization of Ru over Mn with activated oxygen species, providing a qualitative representation of the density of states of the electronic band structure in which the less electropositive character of Ru compared to Mn results in a stronger metal-to-ligand hybridization. The hybridization of Ru with the activated oxygen species occurs by the oxidized Ru 5+ being pushed to a virtual state of Ru 6+ or Ru 5+ and a hole being formed on the O 2 -band. They further described the formation of oxygen vacancies as most likely being triggered by the destabilization of the oxidized O -2p levels. Similarly to Ru-based lithium-rich materials, this hybridization can be further extended to Ni- and Mn-based lithium-rich materials, where the metal ( n d) -ligand (sp) hybridization is commonly seen as a function of the electropositive character or electronegativity and, because of strong electron repulsion, the oxidation state, given that the n d orbitals of the transition metal generally decrease in energy as the metal oxidation state increases. Hence, a more electronegative and highly oxidized transition metal is preferable hybridized to the ligand, which, in this case, is the activated oxygen species. In contrast to the Ru- and Mn-based material, Ni and Mn are both 3d metals and lie close to each other in the periodic table, but Ni has a larger electronegativity and, during the activation of oxygen, Ni is already at a 4+ oxidation state, giving it preference to hybridize with the activated oxygen species over Mn. Thus, Ni hybridizes with the activated oxygen species and subsequently reduces due to the change in coordination mode. 3 However, because of similar characteristics, once Ni begins to reduce at the oxygen-activation plateau, the reduced Ni oxidation state allows for some Mn 4+ to be hybridized with activated oxygen species, thereby reducing Mn slightly, as seen in the XAS data. This Ni valence-state reduction was also observed f or the equivalent Li 1.11 Ni0.33Mn0.56O2, ling to 155 cycles, where LiNi 0.5Mn0.5O2, line shape is starting to show some distortion similar to that of Li 2MnO3 and Li 1.2 Ni0.2Mn0.6O2, nio, coo, LiNi 0.5Mn0.5O2, LII,III -edge XANES spectra for LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2, line shifted past that of LiNiO2, ling began that might be due to high impedance stemming from high Ni/Li exchange (see Table S1, Supporting Information). The discharge capacity observed at 155 cycles was 44 mA · h/g, which is 47% of the fourth-cycle discharge capacity. In contrast, the Li 1.2 Ni0.2Mn0.6O2, LIII -edge line shape changes to resemble that of the LiMn2O4 spinel structure, and the L II -edge shifts toward lower energy, indicating a decrease in the valence below 4+. For Li 1.2 Ni0.2 Mn0.6O2, LII,III-edge XANES spectra in FY mode are shown in Figure 8 for LiNi 0.5Mn0.5O2, line Li[Ni x Li (1 -2 x )/3Mn(2 -x )/3]O2, LiNi0.5 Mn0.5O2, LiNi 0.5 Mn0.5O2, ling the charge/discharge curves represent the di /uniFB00 erent voltage points where XANES analysis was performed. Voltage point 1 is the pristine state, voltage point 2 is a point before oxygen activation ( ∼ 4.45 V), where only the Ni 2+/4+ redox pair compensates the charge in the nickel-containing materials; voltage point 3 is the top of the charge (4.8 V) after the activation of oxygen; and voltage points 4 and 5 are the materials discharged to 3.5 and 2.0 V, respectively. As described in a previous report, the three compositions represent the pure oxygen-activating material (Li2MnO3), the pure solid-state redox reaction material (LiN0.5Mn0.5O2, LII,III-edge in FY mode for (top) LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2, line shape whereas Li 1.2 Ni0.2Mn0.6O2, LII,III-edge XANES spectrum in FY mode and the Ni K-edge XANES spectrum in transmission mode. Previous results also showed that this phenomenon occurs within the surface as well, which was evidenced in TEY mode. 9,28 It is believed that the reduction of Ni due to hybridization with activated oxygen species occurs throughout the material whereas the decrease in hybridization generally occurs within the surface domain. The decrease in hybridization is believed to be the direct result of oxygen vacancy formation that occurs mostly at the surface, possibly as a result slow oxygen migration during oxygen activation. 40 As reported by Qian et al., 40 the transition metal ions in the oxygen-vacancyrich regions are subjected to /uniFB01 ve O-coordination or broken transition-metal-to-ligand bonds on the particle surface, which subsequently leads to the formation of spinel-like phases on the surface. Incorporation of another transition metal has been shown to slightly relieve these electronic structural changes. 28 However, this only serves to delay the eventual changes. 39 In contrast, for the LiNi0.5Mn0.5O 2 end member, the transformation is present only slightly at the 10th cycle and only slightly more at the 155th cycle, as evidenced by the Mn L II,III -edge XANES line shape and the lack of a dramatic decrease in hybridization. However, it should be mentioned that LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2, line shape in Li 1.2 Ni0.2Mn0.6O2, ling was performed for the three compositions to observe and compare the changes after long cycling; see Figure 2. The three compositions were /uniFB01 rst cycled at a rate C / 20 ( C = 250 mA · h/g) for three cycles and then cycled at C /3. For Li 2 MnO3, when cycled for 50 cycles, the discharge capacity was 10 mA · h/g, which represents a drop to 40% of the fourthcycle discharge capacity when the higher-rate cycling began. For LiNi0.5 Mn0.5O2, line. In addition, we also attempted to clarify several of the processes occurring in the Li 2 MnO3 member that still remain elusive and link them to the processes occurring within Li 1.2 Ni0.2Mn0.6O2, lications for electrochemical energy storage, such as increased hybridization of water-splitting catalyst related to improved activity. 27 This might suggest that these changes are related to the transformation of the initial layered structure into a more spinel-like structure. 39 Therefore, it is suggested that maintaining Mn primarily as a spectator metal rather than a participant in the charging mechanism after the /uniFB01 rst cycle is crucial in maintaining structural integrity. Moving across the lithium-rich layered line, Li 1.2 Ni0.2Mn0.6O2, LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2, LII,III-edge XANES spectra, which agrees well with a previous study. 22 To show that Mn does indeed participate in the charge-compensation mechanism after oxygen activation, spectra at the /uniFB01 fth cycle were recorded for Li2MnO3. Figure 7d shows the Mn LII,III-edge XANES spectra recorded for the /uniFB01 fth cycle at the discharged and fully charged states for Li 2 MnO3. It can be seen that the lower-energy position at the discharged state shifted to a higher energy that corresponds to a 4+ valence state and the shape of the L III -edge closely resembles that of the pristine state. To con /uniFB01 rm that these changes were prominent throughout the entire lithium-rich tie line, Mn L II,III -edge XANES spectra were recorded for LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2, ling, in contrast to the current work. This discrepancy might be related to the di /uniFB00 erence in electron dipole transitions between probing K- and L-edges, where the K-edge is a quadruple transition from 1s to 3d whereas the L-edge is a transition from 2p to 3d. Figure 7f shows Mn LII,III -edge XANES spectra for LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2, ling, the peak moves from ∼ 3.7 to ∼ 3.5 and ∼ 3.25 V after the 50th and 100th cycles, respectively. This lowering of the voltage with extended cycling might be related to surface structural changes that are thought to occur due to repeated high-voltage cycling (&gt;4.6 V) and that have also been observed in classical layered materials. 20 For Li1.2 Ni0.2Mn0.6O2, LII,III-edge XANES line shapes and energy shifts. These line shapes and energy shifts resemble those in the LiMn2O4Mn LII,III-edge XANES spectrum. 9 The 3d/4sp band intensity ratio of the O K-edge XANES spectrum shows that there is still a considerable decrease in hybridization between the transition metal and oxygen ligand (loss of ∼ 25%). However, the loss is not as severe as in the Li2MnO3 member, providing evidence for an improved stability due to the involvement of Ni in the oxygen-activation mechanism by avoiding the direct peroxo-/ superoxo-like species with Mn that leads to dramatic electronic structural changes. It is still not clear what speci /uniFB01 c amount of Ni, if any, would be the optimal amount necessary to maintain structural integrity and stability, as one must consider the Li2MnO3 component within the lithium-rich material, where instability arises because of activation of this component, leading to the two mechanisms of hystersis and voltage fade. 4,7 Hence, increased Ni content also means decreased Li2MnO3 content, where, at this time, the contributions from the two cannot be completely separated. In any case, regardless of the speci /uniFB01 c amount of Ni, this study shows that the interaction occurring between Ni and O when oxygen activation occurs directly a /uniFB00 ects the participation of Mn and is not simply a mixture between the two materials Li2MnO3 and LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2, LII-edge are only slight. For LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2, LII,III -edges in TEY mode for (a) Li 2 MnO3, (b) Li1.2 Ni0.2 Mn0.6O2

   Reference Compounds: ling was also reported recently. 14 Inhomogeneities are more easily detected in electrodes that exhibit two-phase behavior during redox, such as LiFePO4. These electrodes have voltage profiles that are flat in the two-phase region, meaning that there is no potential difference to drive equilibration after the current is stopped. 15,16 Thus electrodes are essentially ''frozen'' in the operating state. However, non-uniformity has also been observed ex situ in some systems that exhibit primarily solid solution behavior, in which the voltage profile is sloping, such as LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2, LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2, LiCoO2, LiNi0.4Mn0.4Co0.15Al0.05O2, LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2, limits (4.7 V versus 4.3 V) in lithium half-cells (C.T. et al., unpublished data).

In addition to inhomogeneity at the electrode level, SOC non-equilibrium has also been observed in individual secondary particles and large primary single-crystal particles. 10-12 For example, a heterogeneous SOC distribution has recently been reported in spinel LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 (LMNO) micro-crystals. 13 The evolution of SOC distribution within an LiCoO2

   Reference Compounds: ling the 4 + oxidation state of Mn ions in the NCM811 cathode material [28,29]. The Mn L-edge NEXAFS spectrum of this material also supports this oxidation state (Figure S1). The main energy of the Co ions occurs at 7.721 GLYPH&lt;6&gt; 1 eV, as estimated by the XANES spectrum that coincides with the spectrum of materials with a 3 + oxidation state [30,31]. The Co L-edge NEXAFS spectrum further favors this (Figure S2). The main edge energy value for Ni ions is associated with the 3 + oxidation state, which is characteristic of the NCM811 cathode material and reported by numerous authors [32-34]. This oxidation state of Ni ions is also evident from the Ni L-edge NEXAFS spectrum (Figure S3). The chemical state of the constituent ions of the NCM811 cathode material was investigated using XANES-imaging measurements. Figure 2 shows the XANES spectra of the NCM811 cathode material extracted from the TXM images. In Figure 2, these spectra are shown at the Ni K-edge, Mn K-edge, and Co K-edge extracted from the original TXM images. These spectra exhibit that the main edge energy of Mn, Co, and Ni ions exist at the energy of 6.552 ± 1,  7.721 ± 1,  and  8.342 ± 1  eV, respectively, in this cathode material. These values are higher than those corresponding to metal edges for each ion showing a higher oxidation state of Mn (6.539 eV), Co (7.709 eV), and Ni (8.333 eV) ions in cathode material [27].

Similarly,  at  the  fixed  discharge  rate,  LNMR  showed better  Li-ion  di/uniFB00usivity  and  lower  resistance  in  the  region  of less than 20% SoC (Figure S9, Supporting Information). Based on the GITT calculations, we can conclude that the increase in overpotential is more closely related to Li-ion di/uniFB00usivity rather than electrical  resistance.  The  decrease  of  Li-ion  di/uniFB00usivity  in LMR is due to  the  O-redox  reaction  in  the  region  more  than 4.5  V  since  the  material  is  composed  of  2TM-O-4Li  arrangement.

   Reference Compounds: ling treatments. The intent of the study was to reveal the structure of the resultant,  modified surface through the selectivity  of XAS measurements. Since all Ni species present were introduced by the surface treatment, the Ni K-edge XAS data would help elucidate the structure of the surface brought about by the treatment itself, and the hard X-ray signal would not be contaminated by bulk Ni species originating from the parent material. Analyses of annealed samples revealed that Ni 2+ had been substituted in the Li sites of the TM layers within the Li- and Mn-rich regions of the samples (e.g., LiMn6  NiMn6), facilitated by the leaching of lithium and formation of ~Li3PO4-type surface species. Furthermore, the data revealed the Ni 2+ to be present in a layered environment and active in the electrochemical charge/discharge processes. However, on charging, the Ni 2+ could not be fully oxidized to Ni 4+ . It was suggested, but not verified, that much of the incorporated Ni remained close to the surface and could not be fully oxidized. This work builds on those ideas to create a system where near-surface Ni 2+ , in a layered configuration, may be studied with hard X-ray XAS and STEM-EELS spectroscopy. Two modifications from the previous studies have been made; 1) in order to create a more stoichiometric, layered, NMC-type model cathode, a Li:TM ratio similar to typical NMCs of Li1.06 Mn0.12Co0.82O2, LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2, LiCoO2, LiMO2, ling  Stability  of  LiNixMnyCozO2, LiCl as a flux (oxide:flux = 1:1).

The parameter a was decreased during charging because of the oxidation of transition metals Co and Ni. And the parameter c was increased up to 4.5 V due probably to the electronic repulsions between adjacent oxygen layers caused by the absence of lithium ions. Similar phenomena were observed in LiNiO2

   Reference Compounds: LiCoO2, ling performance is improved noticeably when the material is cycled between potential windows of 5.3 -2.5 V compared to 4.6 -2.5 V. Diffraction data show that structural changes occur at high voltages, the solid-state NMR data of the same samples indicating that the high voltage processes above 4.4 V are associated with Li removal from the structure, in addition to electrolyte decomposition. The NMR spectra of the discharged samples show that cation rearrangements in the transition metal layers have occurred. The XAS spectra confirm that the Mn oxidation state remains unchanged at 4+, whereas Ni 2+ is oxidized to Ni 4+ on charging to 4.4 V, returning to Ni 2+ on discharge, independent of the final charge voltage. A significant change of the shape of the Ni edge is observed in the 4.6 -5.3 V potential range on charge, which is ascribed to a change in the Ni local environment. No O2, lica capillary column, coupled with an Agilent 5973 Mass Selective Detector. The mass selective detector allowed monitoring of (without separating each gas component by chromatography) Ar, CO2, ling between 2.5 and 5.3 V. Because the Ni content in these materials should remain constant, it appears that the loss of structural oxygen on charging is associated with the migration of some of the transition metal ions to the Li layers. We note that a small increase in Ni content in the Li layers was also noted in the earlier study of Li1.12(Ni0.425Mn0.425Co0.15)0.88O2, ling those in Li2MnO3 has decreased noticeably in intensity and appears to be buried under a broader peak centered at 500 -600 ppm. This latter peak likely contains Li environments in the Li layer where the Li is nearby Ni 4+ (diamagnetic) ions and/or Li in the tetrahedral sites, adjacent to the Li vacancies in the transition metal layers. In contrast, the Li ions in the transition metal layers are still not completely removed at this voltage. The results should be contrasted with the Li NMR spectra of Li[Co1/3Mn1/3Ni1/3]O2, coo, LiNiO2, ling of Li[Li1/9Ni1/3Mn5/9]O2

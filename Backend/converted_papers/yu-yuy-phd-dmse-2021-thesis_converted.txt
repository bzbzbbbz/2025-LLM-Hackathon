## Understanding and Exploiting Anion Redox Process for High Energy Density Positive Electrode Materials for Li-ion Batteries

## ABSTRACT

The development of (hybrid) electric vehicles calls for a better solution for energy storage systems. Li-ion battery system give rise to such opportunity by providing reasonable cycle life and energy density. It was widely assumed that Li-ion battery positive electrode materials, Li transition metal oxides, store charges through the redox activity of transition metal species, accompanied by the intercalation  and  deintercalation  of  Li-ions  into  and  out  of  the  host  structure.  Layered  lithium nickel, manganese and cobalt oxides (NMC) are state-of-the-art commercial positive electrodes in the past decades, which relies on the redox of Ni 3+/4+ upon charging, limiting further increase of energy density of current Li-ion battery systems. Anionic redox in positive electrode materials in Li-ion batteries provides an additional redox couple beyond the conventional metal redox, which can  be  harvested  to  further  boost  the  energy  density  of  current  Li-ion  batteries.  However,  the physical origin of observed anion redox remains debated, and more direct experimental evidence is needed. Furthermore, the requirement for the reversible anionic redox activity remains under debate, hindering rational design of new materials leveraging reversible anionic redox.

In this thesis, we primarily focus on understanding the cationic and anionic redox process in the positive  electrode  materials  upon  lithium  deintercalation  using  X-ray  absorption  and  emission spectroscopy  (XAS and XES), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), coupled with density functional  theory  (DFT)  calculations.  We  have  shown  electronic  signatures  of  oxygen-oxygen coupling, direct evidence central to lattice oxygen redox (O 2/(O 2 ) n),  in charged Li 2-x RuO 3 after Ru oxidation (Ru 4+ /Ru 5+ )  upon first-electron removal with lithium de-intercalation. This lattice oxygen redox of Li 2-x RuO 3 was accompanied by bulk Ru reduction. This observed redox trend is in  stark  contrast  of  the  observations  in  charged  Ni-rich  NMC upon charging. In Ni-rich NMC positive  electrodes,  nickel  oxidation  is  primarily  responsible  for  the  charge  capacity  up  to removing ~0.7 Li, beyond which was followed by Ni reduction near the surface (up to 100 nm) due to oxygen release, where there is no significant bulk metal reduction observed. The uniqueness of  Ru-based  system  lies  in  the  highly  covalent  nature  of  Ru-O  bond,  stabilizing  O 2/(O 2 ) nintermediate, forbidding further oxygen release.

Through  systematic  transition  metal  substitution,  we  have  proposed  an  electronic  structure descriptor based on the energetic overlap between transition metal and oxygen to tune the cationic and  anionic  redox  process  in  Ni-rich  NMC  as  well  as  Li-rich  positive  electrode  materials  to enhance their cycling stability. We have also shown that the electronic structure descriptor can be

applied to various electrochemical systems going through redox processes. Our study has laid a solid foundation for future high-throughput screening of novel and affordable metal oxides for battery and electrocatalysis applications.

## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

I could never finish my journey of Ph.D. without the help of the people I have worked with in the past five years. Firstly, I would like to express my greatest gratitude towards my thesis advisor, Prof. Yang Shao-Horn, who has always offered me the strongest academic support and training as well  as  intellectual  freedom  throughout  my  Ph.D.  I  would  also  like  to  thank  Prof.  Jefferey Grossman and Prof. Rafael Jaramillo, who are on my thesis committee and have always provided the most thoughtful suggestions during our discussions in the past years.

I also want to acknowledge all the help from the colleagues in Electrochemical Energy Laboratory that I have worked with in the past five years. I would first like to thank Dr. Pinar Karayaylali, who has always been a great mentor and friend to me when I just started in the lab without knowing anything about electrochemistry experiments, and who was also my beamtime partners for the past five years. I would also like to thank Prof. Livia Giordano, Prof. Yu Katayama and Prof. Ryoichi Tatara, who have been extremely generous to offer their help and have been amazing coworkers and friends throughout my Ph.D. My Ph.D. work was primarily sponsored by BMW, and it could have never been done without the help and guidance from the coworkers including Dr. Filippo Maglia Dr. Roland Jung, Dr. Forrest Gittleson and Dr. Isaac Lund in BMW, who never failed to provide a fresh industrial perspective aside from academia.

A  lot  of  my  work  involves  collaborating  with  scientists  in  national  labs  across  the  States  on synchrotron experiments. I would like to particularly thank Dr. Dimosthenis Sokaras from SLAC on  helping  me  throughout  numerous  beam  times  as  well  as  on  theoretical  calculations.  I  also wanted to thank Dr. Chengjun Sun at APS, Dr. Wanli Yang in ALS in helping me with X-ray synchrotron experiments.

Moreover,  a  lot  of  my  work  could  never  be  completed  without  the  help  and  intellectual  and emotional support from EEL lab members including Dr. Botao Huang, Dr. Yunguang Zhu, Dr. Denis Kutnetsov, Yirui Zhang, Jame Guangwen Sun, Karthik Akkiraju, Graham Leverick, Jaclyn Lunger, Dr. Reshma R. Rao, Dr. Shuting Fang, Dr. Jonathan Hwang, and to name a few. Their support from time to time have really helped a lot in framing my works at EEL.

Furthermore, I would also like to thank my undergraduate thesis advisor Prof. Chris Wolverton, and my mentors Dr. Muratahan Aykol, Dr. Soo Kim at Northwestern University. They had led me into scientific research in batteries, where they had taught me priceless lessons on how to conduct scientific research with creativity and rigor.

Last but not the least, I would like to thank my parents for always being fully financially and emotionally supportive of me taking a relatively different routes compared with a lot of my peers back in high school and college. I simply could not say enough thank-you to them throughout the past years.

## Chapter 1 : Introduction

Since the second industrial revolution and invention of electricity generation, the global production of electricity continues to grow since the last century. The need of electricity demand doubles every ~15 years 1-3 ,  while  coal,  oil  and  gas  are  still  the  major  source  of  electricity  generation. However, this process of generating electricity induces large amount emission of greenhouse gases, therefore since the past 50 years, there is a drive for cleaner electric energy sources including hydroelectricity, nuclear power, as well as renewables including solar energy and wind energy. 4-6 (Figure 1-1 (a)). By projecting the growth rate of renewable power source from 2005 to 2015, researcher have predicted around 120 GW net capacity addition till 2040, larger than the growth of  the  sum  of  from  that  of  oil/coal,  gas  and  nuclear  power. 5 Due  to  the  intermittent  nature  of renewable energy supply, there is an increasing demand for more reliable and clean energy storage solutions. Moreover, the wide use of gasoline powered vehicles results in emission of large amount of greenhouse gases and toxins including NOx and CO, 7  which also calls for high-capacity and reliable energy storage solutions to enable electric vehicles.

nuclear  and  renewables,  where  it  is  predicted  that  there  is  a  significant  increase  in  the  power provided by renewable energy sources.  5

Li-ion batteries are among one of promising energy storage technologies for renewable energies to replace gasoline. (Figure 1-2) Compared to some conventional energy storage technologies such as lead-acid and Ni-hydrides, Li-ion batteries provide more than a two-fold increase in terms of energy and power density. 8  Fuel cells, operating through redox reactions between hydrogen and oxygen (air), provide exciting alternatives to Li-ion batteries for higher energy density 9 . However, there are still widely shared concerns regarding the safety and easiness of hydrogen storage with electric vehicles and mobile electronics. 10   Some emerging technologies such as Li-S and Li-air batteries  give  another  direction  to  further  boost  the  energy  density  of  current  energy  storage devices. However, due to the highly reactive nature of reaction intermediates with the current stateof-the-art electrolytes in Li-S and Li-air batteries, those energy storage devices face significant capacity decay over cycling. 11,12 Moreover, due to the poor kinetics of the redox reactions of Li-S and  Li-air batteries, there are limitations for their  power  densities  compared  to  Li-ion batteries.  . 11,12 As  a  result,  there  is  still  a  long  way  to  go  to  completely  replace  gasoline  with technology  with  matching  energy  and  power  density.  To  further  improve  Li-ion  battery technologies for renewable energy storage and electric mobility, there is an urgent need to boost the energy and power density for the current Li-ion batteries with affordable electrodes. 13

Moreover, with the urgent drive to improve the energy density of current energy storage system, the cycling stability of the energy storage system is also equally important. Typically, increasing the energy density of the energy storage system comes with the concerns with larger degree of cell degradation. This concern is rooted in the notion that larger capacity of battery system is typically associated with more redox active couples, resulting in larger side reactions with the electrolyte and causing capacity degradation. Taking Li-ion battery positive electrode materials for example, as  we  increase  the  energy  density  by  going  from  NMC111  (LiNi0.33Mn0.33Co0.33O2)  to  Ni-rich NMC811  (LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2),  there  is  significant  increase  of  discharge  capacity  from  140 mAh/g to 160 mAh/g by charging to 4.2 VLi, accompanied with more than 8-fold increase in capacity degradation in the first 100 cycles 16 , coming from electrolyte decomposition and electrode degradation.  Moreover,  as  we  introduce  more  lithium  into  the  host  structure  of  the  positive electrode materials to increase the energy density, for example, Li-rich NMC (Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2) 17 can  deliver  discharge  capacity  as  high  as  270  mAh/g  upon  first

discharge, whereas such an increase in the energy density is also coupled with significant capacity and voltage fade. Those recent developments in the positive electrode materials, although have increased significantly the energy density, yet also have induced the issues of more drastic capacity fade.  Therefore,  the  urge  to  increase  the  energy  density  of  battery  systems  should  be  closely coupled with a careful examination of their capacity degradation over cycling to increase their service life.

Like many other energy storage systems, Li-ion battery (LIB) systems store charges through redox reactions in two electrodes, cathode (an oxidant) and anode (a reductant). The cathode and anode are usually separated by an electrolyte, required to be ionically conductive for Li-ions but electronically insulating, so that Li-ions can travel back and forth  in  the  electrolyte  whereas  electrons  need  to  travel  through  the  outer  circuit  to

perform work. (Shown schematically in Figure 1-3)  The open circuit voltage Voc of this system can be expressed as the difference in chemical potentials of anode and cathode:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

As one of the most common intercalation-type cathode materials, Li transition metal oxides (Lix M O2) presumes a layered-layered structure. Upon cycling, Li-ions intercalate and  deintercalate  from  the  host  structures  without  significant  structural  changes  to maintain charge neutrality. It is usually assumed that transition metal species perform redox.  The  reaction  at  the  positive  electrodes,  assuming  full  deintercalation,  can  be generally written as:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where for the anode side, assuming using Li metal anode:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Summing up the two half-cell reactions, we obtained: Li M 3+ O2 = Li + M 4+ O2, where the corresponding voltage of this (de-)intercalcation reaction can be obtained through Nernst equation for one electron transfer:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

,where Δ𝐺3 is the Gibbs free energy of the overall reaction.

This voltage can also be further understood by the energetic difference of M 3+ / M 4+ redox couple  with  respect  to  Li/Li + redox  couple  on  the  absolute  energy  scale  as  shown

schematically in Figure 1-4.  The energy density of Li-ion batteries hinge on the redox capability of positive electrode materials, and mostly on the capability of transition metal redox.

Figure 1-4: Density of states (DOS) of Li transition metal oxide with fermi level located at transition metal d states, above oxygen 2 p states, where the (de-)intercalation voltage can be expressed as the energetic difference between the metal d -states and Li/Li +  redox couple on the absolute energy scale. The relative position of the density of states is based on the difference of electronegativity between typical transition metals and oxygen.

## 1.1.2 Ligand redox behaviors of lithium metal oxides

Ligand  redox,  in  addition  to  metal  redox,  provides  another  possible  redox  center  to further boost the energy density of Li-ion batteries. During the charging process, lithium ions de-intercalate from the oxides while the transition metals are oxidized for charge compensation. As electrons are removed from transition metal valence d states, the Fermi level might cross the oxygen 2 p band. 19  Further oxidation of the materials would induce hole states in oxygen p states, resulting oxidation of the oxygen anion into peroxo- and superoxo-  species  (O2) nand  eventually  into  molecular  oxygen  as  first  proposed  by Tarascon et al . 20

The notion of anionic redox behavior is first manifested in one of the most commonly used cathode materials LiCoO2 back in 1990s, where the oxygen release was observed upon charging up to 4.3 VLi. 21  Ceder et al. 22  have further confirmed this finding using density functional theory (DFT) calculations where oxygen predominantly contributes to the redox activity at high potential. 22  They have also pointed out that within the 3 d metal family, as we go from early transition to late transition metal, this oxygen charge compensation  mechanism  is  augmented.  This  observation  is  due  to  larger  degree  of energetic overlap in terms of density of states between late transition metal d states and oxygen p states, inducing more covalent character of metal-oxygen bond. As a result, the Fermi level is pinned on top of anion p band as we oxidize the materials.

In the past decades, a new family of Li-ion cathode materials, Li-rich layered oxides (LLOs, Li2 M O3), was proposed. Compared to conventional layered materials, Li M O2, LLOs can also be generally written as Li(Li1/3 M 2/3)O2, where 1/3 of the transition metals in the transition metal layer is occupied by Li as shown schematically in Figure 1-5, thus providing  extra  Li  for  (de-)intercalation,  resulting  in  higher  theoretical  capacity. However, to fully employ the extra capacity provided, positive electrode materials need

to provide additional redox couples. The very first LLO proposed by Thackery et al. 23 for  cathode  applications  was  Li2MnO3,  which  presumes  a  C2/m  space  group.  The oxidation state of Mn in the structure is 4+, and since further oxidation of Mn is highly unpreferable,  it  was  once  deemed  as  electrochemically  inactive. 23   However,  upon charging to 4.8 VLi, it can actually be activated, achieving first cycle discharge capacity of more than 200 mAh/g, yet suffering poor cyclability. 24-33 Since then, various efforts have been conducted to investigate the redox process of this material. Robertson 32  and Armstrong 24  have observed that upon oxidation, there is intense oxygen gas evolution. This oxygen evolution is later quantified by Yu et al. 31 , with 0.125 oxygen release per unit of Li extracted. Using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analysis, researchers have also discovered the existence of (O2) 2-  and oxygen vacancy at high potential. 34  Those evidences have pointed towards the significant role of oxygen in the redox process.

Tarascon and co-workers 35-37  have further explored different transition metal chemistry in  the  Li-excess  regime  including  Li2Ru1-xMnxO3  and  Li2Ru1-xSnxO3,  which  can potentially deliver first discharge capacity as high as 230 mAh/g. Interestingly, not like the Mn-based chemistry, this material family does not suffer significant capacity fade and drastic oxygen evolution at high potentials. For those Ru-based materials chemistries, since Ru 6+ cannot be easily accessed, to fully deintercalate the lithium from the materials and deliver such high capacity, oxygen has to participate in the redox. Through X-ray photoelectron  spectroscopy  (XPS), 35,36 they  have  demonstrated  the  existence  of  O -species at 4.6 VLi at first cycle and subsequent cycles accompanied by oxygen lattice

distortion supported by DFT calculations. They have also shown that Ru is first oxidized upon charging to 4.0 VLi then reduced after charging to 4.6 VLi. From those studies, they have  proposed  a  reductive  coupling  mechanism  where  Ru 6+   species  are  stabilized through  modifying  the  coordination  sphere  of  Ru  through  forming  oxygen-oxygen bonding and transferring extra electrons to transition metal for reduction. This proposed reaction pathway eventually forms Ru 5+ -(O2) 2peroxo- species or Ru 4+ -(O2) -  superoxoas shown schematically in Figure 1-6. Some new chemistries have later been proposed and studied, such as Li2IrO3 38 and Li2TiO3 39  based oxides. This library of LLO materials can  be  roughly  divided  into  two  different  subgroups:  (1)  Materials  represented  by Li2MnO3, where oxygen participates in oxidation reactions to form molecular oxygen, and results in dramatic oxygen release at low oxidation potential, inducing relatively poor cycling stability, and (2) another group of materials represented by Li2RuO3 and Li2IrO3, where the oxygen is claimed to be oxidized into peroxo- and superoxo- like species, and these processes are reversible in the subsequent cycles, yielding reasonable capacity and cycle life.

Figure 1-6: Schematics of reductive coupling mechanism in Li-Ru-O lithium-excess positive  electrode  materials,  where  oxygen-oxygen  bonding  is  formed  and  transition metal is further reduced to 5+ or 4+, adapted from Ref  35 .

Recently, researchers have focused on understanding the reasons why different transition metal species would trigger two completely different oxygen redox behaviors as well as the  key  factors  to  utilize  oxygen  redox  to  harvest  more  energy  without  evolving molecular  oxygen.  Using  DFT  calculations  and  crystal  orbital  overlap  population (COOP) analysis, Saubanère et al. 40 have tried to explain the difference between various Li-excess layered materials and proposed that covalent bonds between Ru-O stabilize the  peroxo-like  species  in  Li2RuO3  upon  oxidation,  whereas  Mn-O  bonds  with  less covalency  result  in  further  oxidation  of  peroxo-like  species,  eventually  evolving molecular oxygen. On the contrary, Yabuuchi et al. 39  have proposed that high ionicity would provide minimal overlap between oxygen 2 p states and transition metal d states, suppressing further charge transfer from oxygen to transition metal, eventually reducing oxygen evolution. Additionally, Seo et  al. 41 have attributed the stabilization of anion redox to the strength of M-O bonding, allowing the oxygen atoms to turn towards each other and form oxygen-oxygen bonding. Those works have provided theoretical insights, yet raised completely different, even opposite views on the requirement for oxygen redox activity to be stable and reversible.

Despite  those  experimental  and  theoretical  efforts,  up  to  date  there  is  no  systematic knowledge on the detailed oxygen redox processes, as well as on how the reductive coupling mechanism actually proceed, and how different transition metal species trigger different anion redox processes. Furthermore, there are no unifying descriptors on how

to trigger and control the anion redox process, and up to now most of the discoveries related  to  high  energy  density  positive  electrode  materials  utilizing  anion  redox  are mostly based on trial and error.

## 1.2 Thesis scope

In this thesis, we mainly focus on understanding the mechanisms of ligand redox activity in lithium transition metal oxides as positive electrode materials for Li-ion batteries, as well as methods to employ ligand redox to improve the energy density and cycling stability of current positive electrode materials.

Within Chapter 2, we first study one of the commercially available positive electrode materials layered lithium nickel, manganese and cobalt oxides (NMC) to understand its depth-dependent cationic  and  anionic  redox  process  using  X-ray  spectroscopy. Both  hard  X-ray  absorption (XAS)  of metal K-edges and soft XAS  of  metal L-edges collected from charged LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 (NMC622) and LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811) showed that the charge capacity up to removing ~0.7 Li/ f.u. was accompanied with Ni oxidation in bulk and near the surface (up to 100 nm), respectively. Of significance to note is that nickel oxidation is primarily responsible for the charge capacity of NMC622 and 811 up to similar lithium removal (~0.7 per  formula  unit)  albeit  charged  to  different  potentials,  beyond  which  was  followed  by  Ni reduction  near  the  surface  (up  to  100  nm)  due  to  oxygen  release  and  electrolyte  parasitic reactions.

Chapter 3 compares the redox process of conventional NMC electrodes from Chapter 2 with that  of  Li-rich  ruthenates  using  X-ray  spectroscopy.  In  this  work,  we  have  demonstrated electronic  signatures  of  oxygen-oxygen  coupling,  direct  evidence  central  to  lattice  oxygen redox (O 2/(O2) n),    in  charged Li2-xRuO3 after Ru oxidation (Ru 4+ /Ru 5+ )  upon first-electron removal  with  lithium  de-intercalation.  Experimental  Ru  L3-edge  high-energy-resolution fluorescence  detected  X-ray  absorption  spectra  (HERFD-XAS),  supported  by ab-initio simulations, revealed that the increased intensity in the high-energy shoulder upon lithium deintercalation  resulted  from  increased  O-O  coupling,  inducing  (O-O) 𝜎 ∗ -like  states  with 𝜋 overlap with Ru d -manifolds, in agreement with O K-edge XAS spectra. Experimental and simulated O K-edge X-ray emission spectra (XES) further supported this observation with the broadening of the oxygen non-bonding feature upon charging, also originated from (O-O) 𝜎 ∗ states.  Contrary to NMC electrodes we studied in Chapter 2, in charged Li2-xRuO3 we observed a bulk ligand redox rather a surface oxygen release, which is fundamentally different. This observed  difference  is  rooted  in  the  electronic  structure  between  NMC  and  Li2-xRuO3 electrodes, where Ru, as a 4 d transition metal, has a much more covalent interactions with oxygen, compared to Ni, a 3 d transition metal.

In Chapter 4, by using the understanding from the study in Chapter 2, we have proposed a method  to  tune  the  anionic  activity  in  NMC  positive  electrode  materials  through  anionic substitution  to  increase  the  cycling  stability  of  Ni-rich  NMC  positive  electrodes.  We  have shown that fluorination of Ni-rich NMC811 positive electrodes results in a capacity retention of more than 90% after 100 cycles upon cycling to 4.4 VLi.  The increased cycling stability of F-modified NMC811 can be attributed to the modification of the oxide electronic structures,

where density functional theory calculations (DFT) shows that incorporating fluorine into the oxide lattice decrease the driving force of carbonate dissociation on the oxide surface. In situ infrared Spectroscopy (IR) and ex situ XPS further supports this argument by showing less carbonate oxidation for F-modified NMC811 than as-received NMC811 with increasing cutoff potential or over cycling. The reduced carbonate oxidation is coupled with minimal salt decomposition on the electrode surface, as revealed by XPS.

Within Chapter 5, we further our study in Chapter 3 to understand how to control the bulk ligand  redox  through  electronic  structures  tuning  to  increase  its  reversibility  and  cycling stability. In this work, we employed differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) to monitor the oxygen release and quantify the reversibility of anionic redox of Li2Ru0.75 M 0.25O3  ( M =  Ti,  Cr,  Mn,  Fe,  Ru,  Sn,  Pt,  Ir)  upon  first  charge.  X-ray  absorption spectroscopy, coupled with DFT, show that various substituents have a minimal effect on the nominal  metal  redox,  yet  more  ionic  substituents  and  reduced  metal-oxygen  covalency introduce irreversible oxygen redox, accompanied with easier distortion of M-O octahedron and smaller barrier for forming oxygen dimer within the octahedron. Therefore, a strong metaloxygen covalency is needed to enhance reversible oxygen redox. We proposed an electronphonon-coupled descriptor for the reversibility  of  oxygen  redox,  laying  the  foundation  for high-throughput screening of novel materials that enable reversible anionic activity.

Chapter 6 outlines a perspective that such electronic structure descriptor approach we utilized in Chapter 4 and 5 is not only limited to Li-ion batteries but could be applied to electrocatalysis. We have shown by electronic structure tuning, we could alter the redox position and catalytic

activities. We have presented and discussed a universal origin of inductive effect associated with metal substitution for metal complexes, lithium transition metal oxides and Ni, Co, Febased hydr-(oxides) used for oxygen reduction and evolution reaction  (ORR/OER) electrocatalysis, where the electron levels for metal complex redox are aligned with partially filled metal d states pinned on top of oxygen p bands of oxides on the absolute energy scale. Increased  redox  potential  of  metal  complexes  and  oxides  was  shown  to  correlate  with  the increasing electronegativity of the substituting metal, which is accompanied with enhancement in the ORR/OER activity.

In  this  thesis,  we  survey  different  positive  electrodes  materials  for  Li-ion  batteries  and understand both the cationic and anionic redox processes in those materials upon charging. More importantly, we pinpoint the experimental electronic fingerprints of bulk oxygen redox in  Li-rich  positive  electrodes,  which  is  in  stark  contrast  with  surface  oxygen  release  in conventional  layered  positive  electrodes.  By  further  quantifying  the  reversibility  of  bulk anionic redox across different positive electrode materials, we are able to propose an electronic structure descriptor, based on the degree of energetic overlap between transition metal and oxygen near the Fermi level, that controls the reversibility of anionic redox. This electronic structure  descriptor  can  allow  us  to  rationally  design  novel  and  cheaper  positive  electrode materials to further improve its energy density and cycling stability. This electronic structure approach is not only limited to Li-ion batteries but also could be applied to electrocatalysis or other  electrochemical  systems  undergoing  redox  reactions  to  guide  future  design  of  novel functional materials.

## 2.1 Introduction

LiNi x Mn y Co 1-x-y O 2 (NMC) materials are intensely studied positive electrode materials for Liion  batteries  in  the  past  decades. 1-3 By  increasing  the  Ni  content  in  the  NMC  series  from LiNi 1/3 Mn 1/3 Co 1/3 O 2 (NMC111) to Ni-rich NMCs  including LiNi 0.6 Mn 0.2 Co 0.2 O 2 (NMC622) and LiNi 0.8 Mn 0.1 Co 0.1 O 2 (NMC811), the discharge capacity can be greatly increased to more than 180  mAh/g  at  cutoff  voltages  of  4.3  V Li and  above 2-4 .  However,  the  enhanced  capacity associated with enriching Ni in NMCs 2,3,5 is accompanied with reduced capacity retention 2-7 and lower onset potential 3,4 of  O 2 and CO 2 evolution upon charging. The decreased cycling stability of NMCs 3-5 has been partially attributed to increased oxidation 5,8 of carbonate solvents in  the  electrolyte,  specifically  the  dissociative  adsorption  of  carbonate  solvents  on  surface oxygen sites of NMC to produce protic species 5,7,9 ,  which is associated with greater metaloxygen covalency in NMC 10-12 at given amounts of lithium removal. 10,12 Moreover, increased O 2 loss from Ni-rich NMCs has also been correlated with a more significant capacity loss of Ni-rich NMCs over cycling. However, ambiguities still exist in the details of metal redox in these Ni-rich NMCs regarding when O 2 loss commences upon charging to high voltages, which limits the rational design of stable high-energy positive electrode materials.

X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) 13-18 and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) 14,19,20 have  been  used  for  revealing  depth-dependent  redox  and  structural  evolution  of  positive

electrode materials. 13-20 Tian et al. 14 have used oxygen K-edge and transition metal L-edge soft XAS measurements, which collect the information within 100 nm from the surface,  to show that nickel is oxidized consistently upon charging NMC622 to 4.6 V Li (removal of ~0.7-0.8 Li/ f.u. ), accompanied with minimal oxidation of Co and Mn. These results are in agreement with the observation that no depth-dependent change is noted for EELS spectra of transition metals  of charged NMC622 near the surface to 4.7 V Li after 50 cycles (&lt; 20 nm). 14 Similarly, Kondrakov et al 15 . have combined hard X-ray (depth resolution of a few microns) and soft Xray  (depth  resolution  of  100  nm)  adsorption  spectroscopy  of  charged  NMC811  to  show continuous oxidation of Ni on the surface and in bulk up to 4.6 V Li (removal of ~0.78 Li/f.u.), where the oxidation state of Co and Mn remains largely unchanged. On the other hand, online electrochemical mass spectrometry (OEMS) measurements of O 2 loss from charged NMC622 and NMC811 to 4.4 V Li , 3 have allowed for thickness estimation of formed rock-salt NiO-like surface  layers,    with  a  thickness  of  ~10  nm  for  charged  NMC622  and  14  nm  for  charged NMC811.  These  thickness  estimations  are  in  reasonable  agreement  with  the  observed thickness of ~6 nm of rock-salt on the surface of NMC811 cycled to 4.3 V Li after 83 cycles using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). 19 It is of greater interest to understand whether the formation of these microscopically observed rock-salt layers (with much reduced oxidation state than layered compounds) due to surface O 2 loss can be probed by examining Ni oxidation changes near the surface and in bulk by X-ray adsorption spectroscopy, and how Ni oxidation state  changes  near  the  surface  differ  with  increasing  Ni  from  NMC622  to  NMC811.  This understanding  is  critical  to  designing  Ni-rich  NMC  or  Co-free  electrodes  at  high  cut-off voltages for high-energy Li-ion batteries.

In this work, we employ a combination of soft and hard X-ray absorption spectroscopy (sXAS and hXAS) to probe the surface with total electron yield (TEY) with a depth resolution of &lt;10 nm, and total fluorescence yield (TFY) with depth resolution of 100 nm 14,16 ,  and the bulk 15 (depth resolution &gt; 1 μ m) oxidation of charged NMC622 and NMC811. We examine oxideonly electrodes that are free of carbon and binder obtained at different state-of-charge in the first cycle, focusing primarily on the high state-of-charge compared to previous studies. 15,16 The use of oxide-only electrode allows us to decouple the oxide redox process with binder and carbon parasitic reaction products. sXAS, more sensitive to surface redox than hXAS, revealed that surface redox began to deviate from bulk upon charging NMC622 and NMC811 at 4.2 V Li and above. By combining the oxidation state changes of metal ions from near the surface to bulk, we show that Ni near the surface and in bulk gradually become oxidized up to 4.2 V Li for NMC622 and 4.1 V Li for NMC811 or upon lithium removal of 0.7-0.8/ f.u. , beyond which is accompanied with Ni reduction in the surface regions (10 nm).

## 2.2 Result and Discussion

sXAS TFY and TEY measurements of metal L-edges collected from pristine and charged NMC622 (Figure 2-1) and NMC811 (Figure 2-2) pellets revealed gradual nickel oxidation upon lithium removal up to 0.7 Li/ f.u. (x Li =~0.3) while no significant changes were found for cobalt and manganese. Ni, Mn and Co L-edges of these samples are composed of two major regions (L 3 and L 2 ). The region at low photon energy, referred to as L 3 edge, is corresponding to the transition from 2 p 3/2 to unoccupied 3 d states while the other feature located at high photon energy (10 - 15 eV separation from the L 3 features) is referred to as L 2 edge, is corresponding to the transition from 2 p 1/2. 21,22 As the L 3 edge of 3 d transition metal is around twice as intense

compared to the L 2 edge because the occupancy ratio of the p 3/2 orbital is twice as that of p 1/2, 21 therefore we primarily analyzed changes in metal oxidation with the L 3 edge. 14,16,21 The Ni L 3 -edge doublet of NMC622 (Figure 2-1(a)) and NMC811 (Figure 2-2(a)) collected in the TFY mode was found to have the high-energy peak (peak b) grow at the expense of the low-energy peak (peak a) upon charging to 4.2 V Li (x Li (lithium content) = 0.36) and 4.1 V Li (x Li = 0.35), respectively,  beyond  which  the  trend  was  reserved  upon  further  lithium  removal.  Similar changes were found for TEY Ni L 3 -edge data for NMC622 and 811. (Figure 2-1(d) and 2-2(d)) These  changes  are  indicative  of  nickel  oxidation  up  to  removing  ~70%  of  Li  ,  which  is supported  by  similar  changes  observed  in  reference  compounds  of  nickel  oxidation  states including  Ni 2+ O, LiNi 3+ O 2 and  K 2 Ni 4+ (H 2 IO 6 ) 2 . 23 Further  support  comes  from  the  simulated spectra  using  a  charge-transfer  multiplet  model  (CTM)  developed  by  Groot et  al. 24 ,  where increasing the oxidation state from Ni 2+ to Ni 3+ in an octahedral coordination is accompanied by greater intensity of the high-energy peak compared to the low-energy feature.(Figure A2) Such a trend in intensity ratio is not captured by ab-initio based tools, for example, OCEAN 25 , which focus on having an accurate description of density of states (DOS), as shown in Figure A2. For example, by calculating the Ni L-edges of Li x NiO 2 (x=1, 0.5, 0.33) using OCEAN code, there is no significant difference in the features by removing lithium, coupled with only a tiny shift in the Ni L 3 -edge white line in the relative energy scale, indicative of potential Ni oxidation. The insensitivity of OCEAN to 3 d metal L-edges lies in that for highly-correlated 3 d transition  metals,  the  L-edge  is  overwhelmed  by  the  exciton  (electron-hole  pair)  effect instead of the ground-state density of states, 21 where OCEAN might be not too sensitive in capturing the exciton effect as a function of metal oxidation state. Such an observation is in contrast with a relatively accurate description of 4 d metal L-edge studied in our previous work

using OCEAN, 26 where 4 d metal L-edges is predominantly dictated by ground-state DOS. 21 On the other hand, no noticeable changes were observed for Mn (Figures 2-1(b), (e) and 2(b), (e)) and Co (Figures 2-1(c), 2-1(f) and 2-2(c), (f)) L-edges of charged NMC622 and NMC811, suggesting insignificant changes in their oxidation states upon charging the oxides.

## 2.2.1 sXAS TFY and TEY Ni-L3 and O-K edge measurements of charged NMC622 and NMC811

The ratio of high-energy to low-energy peak intensity in the Ni L 3 doublet of TFY and TEY data was quantified to show the trends in the oxidation state of transition metal in charged NMC622 and NMC811. (Figure 2-3(a) and (e)) It should be noted that these trends found for TFY and TEY data are not dependent on the methods of analyzing the oxidation state, where by using centroid position to extract the oxidation state in Figure A3(a) and (d), we observe similar trends. The peak intensity ratio of pristine NMC622 (Figure 2-3(a)) and NMC811 (Figure 2-3(e)) in the TFY mode is close to that of LiNiO 2 , indicative  of  a  nickel  oxidation  state  of  ~3+.  The  peak  intensity  ratio  of  Ni  TFY  L 3 collected from charged NMC622 and charged NMC811 was found to increase up to 4.2 V Li (lithium removal of ~0.66 Li/ f.u (x Li =~0.34), Figure 2-3(a) ) and 4.1 V Li (lithium removal  of  ~0.65  Li/ f.u (x Li =~0.35),  Figure  2-3(e)),  respectively,  indicating  nickel oxidation in regions 100 nm below the surface. Further Li removal is accompanied with the  reduction  in  the  TFY  L 3 peak  intensity  of  charged  NMC622  and  peak  intensity flattening of charged NMC811. Further insights to nickel oxidation state changes came from  TFY  oxygen  K-edge  sXAS  measurements  of  charged  NMC622  and  NMC811 pellets (Figure 2-4). The pre-peak area of oxygen K-edge TFY (Figure 2-4(c) and (f)) for charged NMC622 and NMC811 was found to first increase upon charging to 4.2 and 4.1  V Li ,  respectively.  As  greater  pre-peak  area  of  oxygen  K-edge  indicates  more

unoccupied states for TM 3d - O 2p states 28,29 and greater Ni-O covalency, increasing the pre-peak area of charged NMC622 and NMC811 further support the oxidation of Ni, in agreement with Ni TFY L 3 measurements. Flattened pre-peak area of oxygen K-edge TFY (Figure 2-4(c) and (f)) for charged NMC622 upon further Li removal suggests no significant nickel reduction or oxygen loss within regions 100 nm from the surface. This argument  is  supported  by  the  amount  of  oxygen  evolution  detected  in  the  previous OEMS  measurements. 3 Considering  oxygen  evolution  only  from  previous  OEMS measurements 3 of charged NMC622 would only translate to negligible nickel reduction (a valence change of 0.007), where we assume oxygen loss from regions within 100 nm of the surface and an average primary particle size of 7 μ m based on the microscopy images  from  previous  work 8 (Appendix  A: Supporting  Information  Note  1  and  2 ). However, the reduction in the ratio of high-energy to low-energy peak intensity in the TFY  Ni  L 3 doublet  of  charged  NMC622  beyond  lithium  removal  of  ~0.66  Li/ f.u. (x Li =~0.34)   (Figure 2-3(a)), which is accompanied with the shift of the TFY Ni L 3 peak centroid (Figure A4) towards lower photon energy, is not well understood, which can be the result from increasing redox contributions from other metal centers other than Ni. For example, at low state-of-charge, slight Co oxidation was observed in Co L-edge TFY (Figure 2-3(d)), which was accompanied with more covalent interaction between Co-O, resulting in a less covalent interaction between Ni-O and Mn-O due to the inductive effect. 30 This argument may explain the reduction of Ni effective charges upon further charge,  requiring  future  studies.  Therefore,  combining  the  TFY  and  previous  OEMS results  suggest  that  charged  NMC622  has  no  considerable  oxygen  loss  and  nickel reduction within regions 100 nm from the surface with lithium removal beyond ~0.8

Li/ f.u. (x Li =~0.2)  In contrast, the pre-peak area of oxygen K-edge TFY (Figure 2-4(c) and  (f))  for  charged  NMC811  was  found  to  decrease  significantly  upon  charging  to voltages  greater  than  4.1  V Li (Figure  2-4(f)),  indicating  considerable  metal  reduction within regions 100 nm from the surface. Such nickel reduction of charged NMC811, observed  mostly  pronouncedly  at  lithium  removal  of  ~0.8  Li/ f.u. (x Li =~0.2)  can  be attributed  to  oxygen  loss  from  oxide  lattice  as  reported  by  previous  OEMS 3 and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) measurements 31-33 . Oxygen loss detected from previous OEMS measurements 3 of charged NMC811 would translate to some nickel reduction (Ni valence reduction of 0.07) upon lithium removal beyond ~0.8 Li/ f.u. (x Li =~0.2) within regions 100 nm from the surface ( Supporting Information Note 2 ),  and  by  attributing  all  of  CO 2 evolution  from  lattice  oxygen,  it  will  result  in  a  Ni valence reduction of 2. Therefore, combining TFY Ni-L 3 and O-K measurements with previous  OEMS results  suggest  that  charged  NMC811  has  considerable  oxygen  loss from the oxide lattice and nickel reduction with lithium removal beyond ~0.8 Li/ f.u. (x Li =~0.2)  within  regions  100  nm  from  the  surface.  Moreover,  by  combining  with previous DEMS result, some of the oxygen loss could contribute to the CO 2 evolution during first charge. 3,4

We further compare Ni L 3 TEY data (probing 10 nm from the surface) with those of TFY (probing 100 nm from the surface) for charged NMC622 and NMC811. The ratio of high-energy to low-energy peak intensity in the Ni L 3 doublet  of  TEY  data  (10  nm) collected from pristine NMC622 (Figure 2-3(a)) and NMC811 (Figure 2-3(e)) was found lower than that of TFY, indicating regions 10 nm from the surface more reduced than

regions  100  nm  below  the  surface,  which  is  commonly  observed  in  transition  metal oxides. 14,17,34,35 Ni  reduction on the surface of pristine NMC622 and NMC811 can be attributed to the formation of surface metal carbonate and/or hydroxyl formation during synthesis and storage in the Ni-rich positive electrode. 36 The formation of Ni and/or Li carbonate is further supported by the O K-edge TEY sXAS data of pristine oxide-only pellets (Figure 2-4), as indicated by the characteristic peak around 532 - 533 eV 37 of carbonates.  The ratio of high-energy to low-energy peak intensity in the TEY Ni L 3 doublet of charged NMC622 (Figure 2-3(a)) was shown to follow a similar trend to that of TFY (Figure 2-3(a)) but with lowered values. These observations suggest that upon charging Ni oxidation state evolution in regions 10 nm from the surface regions traced that observed in 100 nm from the surface but was more reduced. On the other hand, not only the TEY data of charged NMC811 traced the trend of TFY data (Figure 2-3(e)), but also the ratio of TEY Ni L 3 data of charged NMC811 (Figure 2-3(e)) was close to that of TFY data upon charging to 4.2 V Li ,  suggesting that NMC811 surface is less reactive compared to NMC622 at low state-of-charge. These results suggest that regions in ~10 nm from the surface have similar nickel oxidation to bulk upon charging up to 4.2 V Li and become more reduced at a higher state-of-charge. The decreased intensity ratio from the TEY data for charged NMC622 (Figure 2-3(a)) and NMC811 (Figure 2-3(e)) beyond lithium removal of 0.7 Li/ f.u. (x Li =~0.3) could be attributed to the formation of more reduced nickel species such as NiO on the surface, resulting from surface oxygen release and dissociative adsorption of carbonate solvents on surface oxygen sites to reduce the transition metal. 5,9 Unfortunately, further examination of TEY O K-edge sXAS data of charged NMC622 and NMC811 (Figure 2-4 (b) and (e) and Figure A7) revealed no

further insights due to lack of systematic trends with Li removal, suggesting potentially greater influence from the formation of oxygenated electrolyte decomposition products on the surface compared to metal L-edges. From our previous work 5 ,  we have shown that the electrode-electrolyte interface is limited to a thickness of less than 10 nm due to the presence of obvious lattice  oxygen signal in the charged NMC from XPS O1s spectra, therefore O K-edge XAS TEY could be largely affected by the electrolyte decomposition parasitic products deposited on the surface. Finally, the amounts of Li removal for the onset of Ni reduction for regions 10 nm from the surface shown from TEY measurements of charged NMC622 and NMC811 as well as charged LiNiO 2 16 are comparable (~0.7 Li/ f.u (x Li =~0.3))  and  independent  on  the  bulk  Ni  content.  This  observation  of  this surface  Ni  reduction  onset  is  comparable  to  the  observed  onset  voltages  of  oxygen release from charged NMC622 and NMC811 reported from previous literatures. 3,4,31,32 Much lower Ni oxidation state from NMC622 charged to 4.8 V Li compared to NMC811 charged  to  that  voltage  is  contradictory  with  more  reactive  NMC811  surface.  Such discrepancies could be reconciled by the very comparable oxygen evolution amount at 4.8 V Li and 5.0 V Li from previous OEMS measurements. 3 Moreover, due to the difference in  the  electronic  structures  of  NMC622  and  811,  and  the  Ni  L-edge  doublet  ratio quantitative  comparison  across  these  two  different  chemistries  might  not  be  very rigorous.  Further  investigation  using  X-ray  microscopy 38 should  be  employed  to understand the spatial distribution and morphology of the oxide particles charged to such high potentials. It is worthy to note, even though we have included the literature data of the  intensity  ratio  of  Ni  doublet  for  different  Ni  oxidation  states  in  Figure  2-3  to qualitatively  compare  the  oxidation  state  of  charged  NMC  with  the  experimental

reference, we did not extract the exact nominal oxidation state of our samples because such comparison requires corrections of the incident beam dynamics and the quantum efficiency of the detectors for both the literature data and the measurements in this work. We reported the experimental reference for the doublet peak ratio just for a comparison with previous work on LiNiO 2 derived systems. 14,16,17

- 2.2.2 Connecting Ni sXAS with hXAS measurements of charged NMC622 and NMC811 Ni K-edge energy collected from charged NMC622 and NMC811 (depth penetration greater than 1 μ m 39 , Figure 2-3(b) and (f) and Figure A5 (a) and (d)) was found to shift positively upon charging to 4.2 and 4.1 V Li , respectively, beyond which minimal change was  observed.  Metal  K-edge  raw  spectra  comprise  one  major  peak  (Figure  A5), corresponding to the transition from 1s to 4p 40 ,  and  a  minor  feature  at  15  eV  lower photon energy, corresponding to 1s to 3d transition state that is theoretically dipoleforbidden but quadrupole allowed due to slight M-O octahedron distortion. 40 The Ni Kedge of charged NMC622 to 4.2 V Li (Figure 2-3(b) and Figure A5(a)) and NMC811 to 4.1  V Li (Figure  2-3(f)  and  Figure    S4(d))  was  shifted  significantly  to  higher  photon energy. In addition, the Ni K-edge shift is accompanied with shortened Ni-O bond length (~1.97 Å to ~1.89 Å) fitted from Extended X-Ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) analysis of NMC622 (Figures A8(a), S9 and S11(a)) and NMC811 (Figures A8(b), S10 and  S11(b)).  These  observations  indicate  upon  charging  to  4.1  V Li ,  nickel  oxidation largely happen in bulk, in agreement with previous studies of sXAS and hXAS. 15 Further charging to higher voltages (lithium removal beyond ~0.6 Li/ f.u. ) resulted in minimal change observed in bulk coming from Ni K-edge spectra of charged NMC622 (Figure 2-3(b)) and NMC811 (Figure 2-3(f)). Different from the observation near the surface,

further  removing  more  than  ~0.7  Li/ f.u. (x Li =~0.3) . results  in  not  noticeable  further oxidation in the Ni K-edge data of charged NMC622 and NMC811 (Figure 2-3 (b) and (f) and Figure A5(a) and (d)) as well as no further reduction in the Ni-O bond length from the EXAFS spectra (Figure A11 and A12). Similar observations in the Ni-O bond length  have  been  noted  for  charged  LiNi 0.85 Co 0.15 O 2 ,  where  the  Ni-O  bond  length stabilized  at  ~1.89  Å  by  removing  ~0.6  Li/ f.u. (x Li =~0.4) and  more  (Figure  A13). Therefore, Ni K-edge hXAS combined with Ni L-edge and O K-edge sXAS shows bulk and surface nickel oxidation upon lithium removal up to ~0.7 Li/ f.u. (x Li =~0.3), beyond which nickel can become reduced in regions 10 nm from the surface due to oxygen release  and  dissociative  adsorption  of  carbonate  solvents  on  surface  oxygen  sites  to reduce the transition metal. 5,9

It  was  shown  that  for  NMC622  and  NMC811,  the  pre-peak  area increases as a function of voltage upon charging to 4.2 V Li (lithium removal 0.7-0.8 Li/ f.u. ), indicating transition-metal oxidation upon charging followed by a pre-peak area decrease with further lithium removal, which is matching with the sXAS Ni L-edge shown in Figure 2-3. The quantification of the pre-peak area in TEY is shown in Figure A7.

- 2.2.3 sXAS and hXAS of Mn and Co measurements of charged NMC622 and NMC811 Unlike Ni, Co and Mn in charged NMC622 and NMC811 exhibit small changes upon lithium removal from sXAS measurements. The doublet feature of TFY and TEY Mn L 3 edge of charged NMC622 (Figures 2-1(b) and 1(e)) and NMC811 (Figures 2-2(b) and 22(e)) is indicative of Mn 4+ , which is supported by the reference spectra used in this study, simulated spectra from CTM (Figure A2) and previous studies. 41,42 Moreover, for Mn Ledges, as we increase the oxidation state of Mn in the experimental reference (Figure 21(b)) as well as CTM simulated reference in Figure A2, there is an obvious shift for the spectroscopic edge towards high photon energy. It is worthy to note that the CTM model tends to have an overestimation of such shift for Mn 4+ , this inaccuracy in photon energy is also acknowledged in the previous study on Fe-based systems. 43 Upon charging, the TFY Mn L-edge spectra of charged NMC622 and NMC811 remained largely unchanged, with a small shift of the onset edge energy to lower photon energy with increasing Li removal, indicative of slight reduction from Mn 4+ , presumably due to the inductive effect associated with nickel oxidation. No significant changes were found for the TEY Mn Ledge energy (probing 10 nm from the surface) of charged NMC622 (Figure 2-3(c)), indicating negligible Mn reduction, up Li removal to 0.9 Li/ f.u. (x Li =~0.1) In contrast, the  TFY  Mn  L-edge  energy  of  charged  NMC811  decreased  monotonically  with increasing Li removal (Figure 2-3 (g)), suggesting potential subsurface Mn reduction, presumably attributable to the formation of secondary phases such as Mn spinel and/or rocksalt 20,44 on the surface. However, the significance of the observed backshift of Mn, compared to the energy resolution of 0.2 eV for 3d metal L-edge XAS, remains debatable. On the other hand, the peak feature and energy of TFY and TEY Co L 3 edge of charged

NMC622  (Figure  2-1(b)  and  2-1(e))  and  NMC811  (Figure  2-2(b)  and  2-2(e))  is indicative of Co 3+ , which is supported by reference spectra used in this study, simulated spectra from CTM (Figure A2) and previous studies. 42 Similar to what is observed in Mn L-edge references, increase Co oxidation states in the experimental and computational references also induce an obvious positive shift in the edge and centroid. Moreover, the TFY Co L-edge spectra of charged NMC622 (Figure 2-1(c)) and NMC811 (Figure 22(c)) also remained largely unchanged with Li removal, having a small shift towards higher edge onset energy (Figure 2-3(d) and 2-3(h)) with increasing Li removal up to ~0.9 Li/ f.u. (x Li =~0.1). This observed shift is not very significant compared to the energy resolution of spectra which is 0.2 eV. These results suggest that Co oxidation has a small contribution to charge compensation upon lithium removal from charged NMC622 and NMC811. Negligible changes were noted for the TEY Co L-edge energy of charged NMC622 (Figure 2-3(d)) and charged NMC811 (Figure 2-3(h)), indicating no significant changes for Co oxidation in regions 10 nm from the surface, with increasing Li removal to ~0.9 Li/ f.u. (x Li =~0.1).

Moreover, no significant changes were observed for Mn and Co K-edges of charged NMC622 and NMC811 (Figure A5 and Figure A6), albeit there appeared to be a slight positive shift in the edge energy of Co K-edge, indicative of very slight bulk oxidation of  Co  in  NMC811,  especially  upon  charging  to  4.4  V Li and  higher.  Considering  the nominal oxidation potential of Co in Li x CoO 2 at ~3.9 V Li , 45 Co oxidation at substantially higher voltages in charged NMC622 and NMC811 can be rationalized by the argument that  Ni 3+ has  more  covalent  bonding  with  oxygen  as  compared  to  Co 3+ in  LiCoO 2 ,

therefore inducing less covalent bonding between Co and oxygen due to inductive effect, lowering the antibonding states of the Co-O bond, and increasing the oxidation voltage of Co in NMC622 and NMC811. 30 This observation indicates that no matter what the substituents are, unless it is more electronegative than Ni 3+ and redox active, introduction of those cations may not necessarily boost the redox capability of such system and will not delay the surface oxygen release onset potential/capacity.

- 2.2.4 Transition metal redox of charged NMC622 and NMC811 and implication for materials design By combining sXAS with hXAS measurements on Ni, Mn and Co as well as sXAS on O K-edge of charged NMC622 and NMC811, we show that Ni in regions 100 nm from the surface (Figure 2-3(a) and Figure 2-3(e)) and in bulk (Figure 2-3(b) and Figure 23(f))  becomes oxidized upon Li removal  to 0.7 Li/ f.u. , primarily responsible for charge compensation, where Co is slightly oxidized (Figure 2-3(d),  2-3(h), Figure A6(b) and Figure  A6(d))  and  Mn  is  slightly  reduced  (Figure  2-3(c),  2-3(g),  Figures  A6(a)  and A6(c)). These changes indicate that the Ni 3+ 3 d states are above Co 3+ 3 d states, which are above Mn 4+ 3 d states, in NMC622 and NMC811. Beyond Li removal to 0.7 Li/ f.u. , there is no significant oxygen loss and nickel reduction in bulk and in regions 100 nm from both Ni L-edge and K-edge as well as O K-edge measurements. On the other hand, Ni cations in regions 10 nm from the surface of charged NMC622 (Figure 2-3(a) and Figure 2-4(c)) and NMC811 (Figure 2-3(e) and Figure 2-4(f)) becomes noticeably reduced upon Li removal of ~0.7 Li/ f.u. (x Li =~0.3) and higher, which onset is independent on bulk Ni content in NMC. The onset state of charge (Li removal of 0.8/ f.u. . (x Li =~0.2)) matches 31-33 3,4

with previous DEMS and OEMS measurements on NMC622 and NMC811 as well

as other Ni-based systems such as LiNiO 2 , where oxygen release starts at state-of-charge around 80%. 16 These observation suggest that the observed Ni reduction in regions 10 nm from the surface upon Li removal of 0.8 Li/ f.u . and higher can be attributed to oxygen release from oxides as well as dissociative adsorption of carbonate solvents on surface oxygen sites to reduce the transition metal and form protic species. 5,9 The greater oxygen loss found from charged NMC811 than charged NMC 622 at Li removal of ~0.8 Li/ f.u. (x Li =~0.2) from previous OEMS measurements is accompanied with greater Ni reduction in regions 10 nm from the surface for charged NMC811 (Figure 2-3(e) and Figure 2-4(f)) but minimum reduction of Co and Mn. Therefore, while Mn and Co may have stabilizing effects for Ni-rich NMC at high state-of-charge 2,46 ,  the redox of Ni 3+/4+ (Figure 2-5) is largely responsible for charge compensation in Ni-rich oxides during reversible lithium intercalation and irreversible oxygen release .

Figure 2-5: Schematics of the surface and bulk Ni redox process of Ni-rich NMC622 and 811 summarized from the sXAS and hXAS data shown in Figure 2-2, Figure 2-3 and Figure 2-4, where the bulk and surface of the pristine NMC experienced Ni oxidation upon charging by removing around 0.7 Li + / f.u. , coupled with depleting electrons from the metal states. This is followed by a surface Ni reduction upon further charging, coupled with oxygen release reported by previous literatures, and back-filling of electrons to the Fermi level from oxygen due to oxygen vacancy creation. 3,4,31-33,47 The oxygen release is coupled with the electrolyte decomposition  reactions  where  the  carbonate  solvent  dissociative  adsorbs  on  the  oxide surface, reducing the transition metal, forming protic species, which could further attack the salt species. 5

The observed metal redox process presented in this work, where the cationic capacity has limited dependence on bulk Ni content, points towards two major strategies of bulk materials design that can further push the Ni redox capacity that is eventually free of Co.

The first strategy points towards cationic substitution contributing to the redox in parallel with Ni 2.x+/4+ redox, requiring similar and even slightly higher electronegativity compared to Ni 3+/4+ states. Such consideration lies in that electronegativity is directly correlated with

the metal redox level, where more electronegative substituents introduce more covalent M-O interaction and lower down oxidation voltage of the substituent in comparison to Ni  redox  due  to  inductive  effect. 30 This  strategy  points  toward  substitution  of  more delocalized and slightly more electronegative 4d and 5d transition metals in the system such  as  Nb 4+ ,  Ru 4+ ,  Rh 4+ ,  Pt 4+ ,  W 4+/5+ and  etc.  Another  strategy  includes  reducing  Ni oxidation state through cationic dopants of higher oxidation state compared to oxygen. By introducing metal with a higher oxidation state than Mn 4+ , Ni can be further reduced closer towards 2+, providing more capacity before reaching Ni 4+ and oxygen release, for example Nb 5+ and W 5+ can fulfill such purpose. Recently, W dopants are also explored by Ryu et al. 48 ,  and showed promising performance with suppressed H2 to H3 phase transition, hinting at less degree of oxygen release. The design strategies we discussed are  only  targeted  at  improving  the  bulk  redox  capability  of  Ni-based  oxides,  yet  the capacity retention in the subsequent cycles also hinges on the interfacial reactivity of the oxides  towards  the  electrolyte.  Even  though  in  this  work,  we  have  shown  minimal dependence of Ni redox process on bulk Ni content, in our previous works on interfacial reactions of Ni-rich positive electrodes towards the electrolyte, the interfacial reactivity is  directly  related  to  Ni  contents  and  is  closely  related  to  cycling  stability  of  the electrodes. 5,7,49 Therefore, when designing the bulk oxides, consideration on the methods to mitigate oxide reactivity towards carbonate also needs to be taken, which includes extra consideration on surface treatment and processing and storage conditions, which could have a large impact on the interfacial reactions and reversible capacities.

## 2.3 Conclusions

In this work, we combined soft and hard X-ray absorption spectroscopy to study the redox process of Ni, Mn and Co in Ni-rich NMC. We have shown that compared to hXAS, sXAS is much more sensitive to the surface processes, which are dominating at high state-of-charge. We observed  through  Ni  L-edge  TEY  and  TFY,  as  well  as  O  K-edge  TFY,  a  consistent oxidation of Ni up to removing around 0.7 Li/ f.u. (x Li =~0.3) in NMC622 and 811 to a nominal oxidation state of around 4+ in both bulk and surface, followed by a surface Ni reduction back to Ni 3+ . Such reduction is only limited to the region within 10 nm from the surface, shown by stagnant bulk Ni K-edge onsets at high state-of-charge. Meanwhile, Co and Mn show minimal participation in this redox process from both hXAS and sXAS characterization. The surface Ni reduction  process  is  the  result  of  surface  oxygen  release,  and  directly  correlated  with irreversible capacity in the formation cycle. The onset of this reduction matches perfectly with the observed OEMS oxygen release onset and is state-of-charge dependent (70-80% state-ofcharge),  yet  not  bulk  Ni  content  dependent.  Through  those  findings,  an  overall  depthdependent redox mechanism is proposed for Ni-rich NMC, which provides insights in future bulk material design of Ni-based electrodes to further boost its reversible capacity.

## 2.4 Methods

Electrode  preparation NMC622  (LiNi 0.6 Mn 0.2 Co 0.2 O 2 )  and  NMC811  (LiNi 0.8 Mn 0.1 Co 0.1 O 2 ) were obtained from ECOPRO, South Korea. The pristine particles of NMC622 and 811 are around 7 µm, shown by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in our previous characterizations, 50 rendering the comparison between them in this study very fair. Moreover, the pristine materials are free of impurities as shown in X-ray diffraction (XRD) in Figure A14. In this study, we employed oxide-only electrodes since using composite electrodes introduces the complexity of oxygenated species from the binder and carbon upon charge, where inclusion

of the binder and carbon might introduce difficulty in the interpretation of the data through forming oxygen-containing parasitic products at high potentials which could affect the O Kedge XAS spectra. The pellet electrode was prepared through pelletizing around 48 mg of active materials using 6 mm diameter pressing die set (Across International) for 15 mins. The pellets were then sintered under oxygen flow at 750 ¡C and 725 ¡C for 6 hours, for NMC622 and 811, respectively. The cooling and heating rates are controlled to be 2 ¡C/min. The pellet electrodes are then broken into pieces of around 3 mg each, then dry in vacuum under 120 ¡C overnight before transferred into an argon-filled glovebox (&lt;0.5 ppm of H 2 O and O 2 ).  The oxide-only electrode has very comparable electrochemistry profile to composite electrode 3,4 when cycling to 4.8 V Li and discharge back to 2 V Li, as shown in Figure A15.

Electrochemistry Electrochemical behavior of the electrodes was confirmed by galvanostatic measurements  in  two-electrodes  cells  (Tomcell  type  TJ-AC).  Cells  were  assembled  in  an argon-filled glovebox (&lt;0.5 ppm of H 2 O and O 2 ) and comprised a lithium metal foil as the negative electrode and the positive electrode, separated by two pieces of the polypropylene separator (2500 Celgard), impregnated with 150 μ L of different electrolytes including LP57 (1M LiPF 6 in a 3:7 ethylene carbonate (EC): ethylmethyl carbonate (EMC) electrolyte (BASF)). After  assembly,  the  cells  rested  for  6  h  prior  to  measurement  and  then  were  charged  with different end-of-charge potentials (4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.6 and 4.8 V Li ) at a C/100 rate (2.8 mA/g), based  on  the  theoretical  capacity  calculated  assuming  full  delithiation.  The  cells  were maintained at the end-of-charge potential for 5 h before disassembly in the glovebox. For the charged pellet electrode, they were rinsed in 1 mL of EMC solution with stirring for 24 h to remove the residual electrolyte and electrolyte decomposition products on the surface. The pellets were then dried in vacuum for 4 h before further characterization using XAS.

Synchrotron measurements Transition metal L-edges and O K-edge XAS were conducted in Canadian Light Source (CLS) beamline 10 ID-2 on the charged pellets and transition metal Kedges  XAS  were  conducted  at  the  Stanford  Synchrotron  Radiation  Lightsource  (SSRL)  at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, Beamline 6-2b in transmission mode with an active materials mass fraction of 10 %, diluted with sucrose, using a Si(111) analyzer. The soft X-ray XAS measurement is aligned with TiO 2 reference. The hard X-ray spectra are aligned using the Si(111) glitches. All spectroscopy data were normalized and processed using the ATHENA software  package. 39 For  O  K-edge  and  transition  metal  K-edge  XAS,  the  spectra  were normalized by reducing the pre-edge to intensity of 0, and the continuum after the whiteline to intensity of 1. The metal L-edge spectra were background-subtracted by fitting a polynomial, and the maxima was normalized to 1. The edge onset energies for Co are extracted by linear extrapolating the energy at 0.5 of the maximum of the intensity of the XAS spectra, whereas for  Mn  the  edge  onset  energies  are  extracted  by  extrapolating  the  energy  at  0.2  of  of  the maximum intensity of the XAS spectra due to the low-energy shoulder of the spectra. For soft X-ray measurement, the samples are sealed inside the argon-filled glovebox in the aluminum foil bag before transfer into the XAS chamber. While mounting the sample holder to the XAS chamber there is a certain period of exposure in air which is minimized down to less than 5 seconds. We believe what we have observed in XAS TEY is not affected by such a short time of exposure to air as there is no obvious signal of air exposure products 36 such as LiOH 51 and Li 2 CO 3 37 in O K-edge TEY in the charged oxides . Furthermore, there is a very consistent trend observed in Ni L-edge in terms of Ni oxidation and very comparable with previous literature report in similar chemistries. 16 The TFY data is definitely not affected by such short exposure considering the probing length scale is around 100 nm. Furthermore, TFY of 3 d metal L-edge

suffers from self-absorption issues, and this could be alleviated by using the inverse partial fluorescence yield (iPFY) which is the inversed intensity of O K α emission in the RIXS. 52 iPFY mode is partially eliminated with obvious self-absorption and line distortion. 53 As shown in Figure A16 and A17, iPFY shows very consistent trend with the TFY data even though with different doublet ratio for Ni due to the line distortion and saturation in TFY. However, we still keep the TFY information in the main text and iPFY in Appendix A, because TFY is much more widely used in the literatures 14,16,17 which allows us to compare with literature data 14,16,17 as shown in Figure 2-3.

## 3.1 Introduction

The  redox  process  of  positive  electrode  materials  largely  dictates  the  energy  density  and cycling stability of the Li-ion batteries. Conventional positive electrode materials including LiCoO2 and LiNixMnyCozO2, with layered structures, hinge on the reversible redox couples of 3 d transition  metals  including  Co 3+ /Co 4+ , 1-2 Ni 2+ /Ni 4+ (or  Ni 3+ /Ni 4+ ) 3-4 and  Mn 3+ /Mn 4+ , 5-6 accompanied by lithium (de-)intercalation, delivering a capacity of around 140 mAh/g, 1-6  upon charging to 4.3 V with respect to Li metal (VLi). This redox process is rooted in the electronic structure  of  lithium  early  transition-metal  oxides.  Because  of  their  large  electronegativity difference, oxygen 2 p -states lie well below the transition-metal d -states; hence, the Fermi level has a predominantly metallic character, and the transition metals mainly undertake the burden of  the  redox  reaction. 7-9 For  most  transition  metals,  this  cationic  redox  scenario  usually provides one electron per metal site and poses significant limitations on the energy density of positive electrode materials for mobile devices and automotive applications. 9  However, as we move from early to late transition metals, or to higher valence metal states via lithium deintercalation, we increase the electronegativity of the transition metal species. 10 This results in a larger degree of energetic overlap between the metal d -states and the oxygen p -states, and therefore a more covalent interaction between the transition metal and oxygen. 8-9, 11  In this scenario a direct extraction/replenishment of the electron density from the oxygen density of states can occur. 7-8, 12 This scenario is usually referred to as anionic redox, in contrast with

conventional cationic redox. The notion of anion redox arose for the first time in LiCoO2 in the 1990s, where oxygen release was observed upon charging up to 4.4 VLi. 13  Ceder et al. 12 explained this finding using density functional theory (DFT) calculations in which both metal and oxygen contribute to the redox processes at high potentials. 12 Within the 3 d transiton-metal family,  going  from  early  transition  metals  to  late  transition  metals,  this  oxygen  charge compensation mechanism is augmented because of a more covalent metal-oxygen framework 12 .

Li-rich layered oxides, Li2 M O3 ( M = Ru, Ir, Mn), 8, 11, 14-22  have been studied extensively and offer much higher energy density than Li M O2 by providing more lithium for (de-)intercalation. These oxides can be written generally as Li(Li1/3 M 2/3)O2, with 1/3 of the transition metal sites within the transition-metal layer occupied by Li. This Li excess allows a higher transitionmetal valence (4+), compared to Li M O2 (3+), and therefore leads to more overlap between transition metal and oxygen states, resulting in a highly covalent M -O bonding. 7, 10, 12   These reported Li-rich metal oxides can be divided into two classes. The first class is represented by oxides  derived  from  Li2MnO3, 17-18,  21,  23-37 which  exhibits  a  relatively  poor  reversibility attributed  to  oxygen  redox  (oxidation)  into  molecular  oxygen,  leading  to  oxygen  loss. Although Li2MnO3 can yield a first cycle discharge capacity higher than 200 mAh/g, upon charging to 4.8 VLi, 25, 29-32, 34-35 it suffers from a poor cycling performance. 23, 29-31  Considerable oxygen loss occurs upon charging Li2MnO3 17,32 , where 0.125 oxygens can be released per unit of extracted Li 30 .  The Li2MnO3 derived compounds such as Li(LixMnyNizCo1-x-y-z)O2 (Li-rich and Mn-rich NMC) introduce additional redox couples (Ni 2+ /Ni 4+  and Co 3+ /Co 4+ ) that may boost  both cationic and lattice oxygen redox, reaching a reversible capacity of around 300 mAh/g. 36-38 Although  their  cycling  stability  is  much  improved  compared  to  pure  Li2MnO3

electrodes, they still suffer from a significant voltage decay over subsequent cycles 37 , and the oxygen redox contribution to the redox process is diminished upon extended cycling. 37  The second group of Li-rich metal oxides is derived from noble metals including Li2RuO3 11, 39-41 and Li2IrO3, 42-43  which show reversible capacities with a two-electron transfer process and a high  cycle  life.  For  example,  Tarascon  and  co-workers 15-16,  39-40 have  shown  that  Li2Ru1xMnxO3 and Li2Ru1-xSnxO3 deliver first discharge capacities as high as 250 mAh/g, 16, 39-40 and a capacity retention of higher than  80 % after 100 cycles. 16, 39  It has been proposed that the capacity corresponding to the second electron transfer results from reversible lattice oxygen oxidation into peroxo- and superoxo- like species in the bulk. 11, 16, 39-40

The mechanism giving rise to the reversible capacities associated with the lattice oxygen redox is  not  well  understood.  Unambiguous  experimental  evidence  or  an  electronic  structure signature for lattice oxygen redox for these Mn-, Ir- and Ru- based oxides is missing. There are primarily two schools of thought on the physical origin of lattice oxygen redox in Li-rich oxides. The first class of proposed mechanisms argues that anion redox induces the formation of (O2) nperoxo-like species, 11, 39-41, 43 and the redox couple O 2- /(O2) n-  can proceed reversibly upon cycling. A certain M-O bond covalency is required for reversible oxidation of the anion as  proposed  by  Doublet,  Tarascon  and  coworkers. 11,  41 Tarascon et  al. have  proposed  the existence of peroxo-like O2 nspecies for Li2-xRuO3 at 4.6 VLi during the first cycle via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies. 16, 39  The formation of such peroxo-like species is accompanied by Ru reduction which is referred to as a reductive coupling mechanism. 11, 40  The Ru 6+  species are stabilized by modifying the coordination sphere of Ru through oxygen-oxygen bond  formation  and  the  transfer  of  extra  electrons  to  the  transition  metal  for  reduction,

eventually forming Ru 5+ -(O2) 2peroxo- species or Ru 4+ -(O2) -  superoxo-species. However, we should note that the XPS measurement has a penetration depth of only 5-10 nm 44 . Therefore, the evidence provided by XPS is from the surface and subsurface of the materials which is likely not representative of the bulk. Moreover, the XPS fingerprint is not clear and cannot be unequivocally assigned to peroxo-like species, but might also come from surface electrolyte decomposition  products.    Hence,  there  is  no  unambiguous  experimental  evidence  from  an electronic  structure  perspective  to  support  this  proposed  redox  process.  The  formation  of peroxo-like species is  further  demonstrated  and  visualized  by  McCalla et  al. 43 using  highresolution transmission electron microscopy and neutron diffraction in delithiated Li2-xIrO3, where an O-O bond distance of around 2.4 Å has been shown. 43  In addition, Saubanère et al. 11 have  reported  from  crystal  orbital  overlap  population  (COOP)  analysis  that  the  covalent bonding  between  Ru-O  stabilizes  the  peroxo-like  species  in  Li2-xRuO3  upon  oxidation.  In contrast,  the  Mn-O  bond  has  less  covalency,  resulting  in  further  oxidation  of  peroxo-like species and eventually evolving molecular oxygen. This idea has also been further explored by Bruce and coworkers. 36  Their O K-edge resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) study on Li-rich and Mn-rich NMC showed an increased intensity of the elastic peak (around 531 eV) upon  charging  to  around  4.4  VLi,  a  fingerprint  they  assigned  to  the  formation  of  oxygenlocalized  electron  holes. 36 However, the rationale  for  such  an  assignment  remains  unclear. Moreover,  there  is  no  strong  indication  of  true  peroxide  or  superoxide  species  formation because there is no clear Raman signal from 800 cm -1  to 1100 cm -1  in ex situ charged Li-rich NMC  samples, 36 the characteristic  wavenumber  range  for  alkali  metal  peroxide  and superoxides. 36 Bruce  and  coworkers  have  concluded  that  the  reversibility  of  anionic  redox

relies on more delocalized O holes, which require more delocalized M-O bonds from higher M-O covalency.

In  the  second  school  of  thought,  the  oxygen  redox  of  Li-rich  oxides  is  attributed  to  the reversible oxidation and reduction of the non-bonding oxygen density of states created by LiO-Li configuration, 45-46 unique to Li-excess or disordered oxides. Because of the high ionicity of Li-O interaction, the oxygen 2 p orbital bond with lithium resembles a lone-pair non-bonding oxygen,  and  its  density  of  states  lies  at  a  higher  electron  energy  level  compared  to  the corresponding ones of transition metal bonded oxygen (bonding oxygen), thus providing a more facile electron transfer from oxygen. 45  Therefore, oxygen redox can be represented as a redox couple of O 2- /O - , where electron density is directly taken from non-bonding oxygen 2 p states. However, there is no unequivocal experimental evidence that oxygen redox proceeds as a  redox  couple  of  O 2/O without  oxygen  sub-lattice  distortion.  This  mechanism  is  further extended by Gent and Chueh 38, 47 , where they proposed that anionic redox is a dynamic process, requiring  synergistic  transition  metal  migration  and  O 2/O redox  couple. In  situ X-ray diffraction  (XRD)  and  RIXS 38 on  Li-rich  and  Mn-rich  NMC  (Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2) demonstrated  that  the  oxygen  redox  and  the  transition  metal  migration  are  coupled.  The oxygen-bonded transition metal migrates to a tetrahedral site, creating nonbonding oxygen 2 p states  on  the  de-coordinated oxygen. Similar to what Seo et  al. 45 have  proposed, this nonbonding oxygen can perform O 2- /O redox, coupled with continuous transition metal migration. In particular, a RIXS feature with an emission energy of 523.7 eV, different from the 525 eV emission feature for conventional O 2-  species, could be assigned to the anionic redox state in both Li-ion and Na-ion battery electrodes. 38, 48   However, although further theoretical study

shows that this specific RIXS feature corresponds to excitations into unoccupied O -2p states, e.g. ,  oxidized oxygen because 2p orbitals  of  O 2are  full  occupied,  a  simple  extension of a peroxide model into transition-metal oxide material remains questionable 49 .

In  this  study,  we  find  unambiguous  evidence  of  lattice  oxygen  redox  upon  lithium  deintercalation  from  Li2RuO3.  By  coupling  hard  and  soft  X-ray  absorption  (XAS)  and  X-ray emission  spectroscopy  (XES)  experimental  studies  with ab  initio Bethe-Salpeter  equation (BSE)  spectroscopy  calculations 50 ,  we  capture  the  redox  processes  of  both  oxygen  and ruthenium  in  Li2-xRuO3  upon  the  first  charge,  which  contrasts  the  redox  process  of conventional  battery  materials  including  LiCoO2 and  LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2.  This  detailed characterization  of  the  redox  process  allows  us  to  qualify  different  previously  proposed hypotheses and experimental studies regarding lattice oxygen redox. Furthermore, combining the redox process with differential mass spectrometry (DEMS) measurements, we evaluate the reversibility of the anionic redox of Li2RuO3 and discuss the implications for the design of high-energy positive electrode materials leveraging anionic redox.

## 3.2Result and Discussion

3.2.1 Electronic signatures of oxygen-oxygen coupling in Li2-xRuO3 XAS and XES on the charged oxide-only pellet electrodes, without conductive carbon and binder, revealed electronic structure evidence of oxidation of non-bonding oxygen in Li2-xRuO3. Both O K-edge XAS total fluorescence yield (TFY) and Ru L3-edge highenergy-resolution fluorescence-detected (HERFD)-XAS  of  the  pristine electrode (Li2RuO3) were composed of two major peaks ( c.a. 528.8 eV and 530.8 eV for the O Kedge in Figure 3-1(a) and 2841.1 eV and 2843.6 eV for the Ru L3-edge in Figure 3-1(b)).

A b initio theoretical calculations with OCEAN 50-51  using the pristine Li2RuO3 structure ( C2/c ) 52-53  resulted in simulated O K-edge (Figure 3-1(a)) and Ru L3-edge (Figure 3-1(b)) spectra  that  agree  well  with  the  experimental  spectral  fingerprints  of  the  pristine electrode.  Furthermore,  these  calculations  also  enabled  us  to  visualize  the  electron densities corresponding to specific excited state features. The low-energy peak can be attributed to a t2g feature, having a metal 4 dxy (degenerate with 4 dyz and 4 dzx ) orbital with a 𝜋 overlap with O 2 p states, whereas the high-energy peak can be attributed to the eg * states, comprising the 𝜎 ∗ overlap between transition metal 4 dx2-y2 states and O 2p states, as shown in Figure 3-1(c). Here we should note that the computed spectra have slightly larger t2g and eg splitting compared to the experimental spectra, which indicates that we have an overestimation of the ligand field. Moreover, as we might note that in the pristine experimental Ru L3-edge XAS spectra of Li2RuO3 (Figure 3-1(b)), there is a small highenergy shoulder which is not understood, which might potentially come from mixed oxidation  states 54-56 ,  and/or  surface  reacting  with  moisture  undergoing  proton  and lithium  ions  exchange. 57 It  is  worth  noting  this  feature  has  never  been  reported  by previous Ru L3-edge measurements of Ru-based oxides 58  and complexes 54-55  because they were limited by the significant core-hole lifetime broadening and therefore, such small feature was not resolved, which requires further studies.

Figure 3-1: (a) O K-edge XAS collected in TFY mode, and (b) Ru L3-edge HERFD-XAS spectra of Li2-xRuO3 pellets as a function of charging potential (3.6 VLi, 3.8 VLi, 4.2 VLi, 4.4 VLi, and 4.6 VLi). Corresponding simulated spectra of the Li2RuO3, Li1RuO3, Li0RuO3, as well  as  Li2RuO3-δ, Li1RuO3-δ,  Li0RuO3-δ (δ  =0.25), are  also  shown  for  comparison, representing the structures with oxygen vacancies. The calculated O K-edge and Ru L3-edge spectra are shifted by 528 eV and 2884 eV, respectively, to allow for a direct comparison with the experimental spectra. The computed features labeled 'a*' and 'b*' match with the experimental  features  'a'  and  'b'  in  the  pristine  Li2RuO3.

Upon charging, the low-energy t2g peak intensity (integrated area) gradually increased up to 3.8 VLi, and then decreased, relative to that of the high-energy eg feature, in both O Kedge XAS (Figure 3-1(a) and Figure B1(a)) and Ru L-edge HERFD XAS (Figure 3-1(b) and Figure B1(b)). The increase of the t2g peak  integrated  area  up  to  3.8  VLi,  which corresponds to the first lithium de-intercalation per formula from Li2RuO3 in the lowvoltage plateau at 3.6 VLi as shown in Figure 3-1(d), can be attributed to the removal of approximately  one t 2g electron  upon  oxidation  of  Ru 4+ to  Ru 5+ in  Li2-xRuO3. Similar spectroscopic changes have been reported for oxides relying predominantly on cationic redox including LiCoO2 59-60  and LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 61 , where the  metal L-edge shifts monotonically  and  the  pre-peak  area  in  O  K-edge  XAS  increased, 59-61 marking  the removal of the electron from transition metal d states upon lithium de-intercalation. On the other hand, upon charging to voltages greater than 3.8 VLi, the eg feature in both Ru L3-edge and O K-edge spectra was found to grow relative to the low-energy t2g peak and broaden  considerably  on  the  high-energy  side  (Figure  3-1(a),  (b),  and  Figure  B1). Through DFT calculations, we determined the most energetically favorable structures at different  lithium  contents  of  Li2-xRuO3  by  enumerating  all  possible  configurations (computational details are shown in the Methods section). Simulated Ru L3-edge (Figure 3-2(a) and (c)) and O K-edge (Figure B4) spectra of Li2-xRuO3 revealed the appearance of a high-energy shoulder in the vicinity of the eg feature for Li0.5RuO3 and Li0RuO3, which could potentially account for the broadening observed in the experimental spectra. Aided by a charge density visualization at the shoulder peak energy, we assigned this feature  to  a  stronger  oxygen-oxygen  (O-O) 𝜎 ∗ -𝑙𝑖𝑘𝑒 antibonding  states  with  a 𝜋 ∗ overlap with transition-metal d -manifolds (Figure 3-2(b)). This combined experimental

and simulated approach for the Li2-xRuO3 revealed electronic structure evidence for the antibonding state of oxygen-oxygen coupling associated with lattice oxygen redox in bulk proposed previously from DFT studies.  11

Figure 3-2: (a) Calculated Ru L3-edge HERFD XAS and (c) calculated and experimental difference spectra of Li2-xRuO3. Upon delithiation, an additional peak appears at a photon energy just above the eg feature. The electron density of this excitation shows it to be an (OO) 𝜎 ∗ -like feature hybridized with Ru d-manifolds because of oxygen cage distortion and shortening of the O-O bond from 2.8 Å to 2.4 Å upon delithiation, as shown in the schematic in (b). (d) Experimental Ru L3-edge HERFD XAS of Li2-xRuO3 charged to 4.6 VLi (red) and pristine  Li2-xRuO3  (black),  where  a  broadening  of  the  eg  peak  was  observed  with  higher intensity at higher photon energy, matching with the observation in the computed spectra, and  can  be  attributed  to  the  creation  of  a  (O-O) 𝜎 ∗ -like  feature.  The  voltage  profile determined from the DFT-calculated structure of Li2-xRuO3 is shown in comparison with the experimental profile in Figure B5.

Theoretical spectra simulations of other candidate structures show that the experimentally observed changes in the O K- and Ru L-edge XAS spectra cannot be solely  explained  by  introducing  oxygen  vacancies  in  Li2-xRuO3,  which  is  known  to evolve oxygen gas at voltages around 4.2 VLi, 40   nor by true peroxo- (dO-O ≈1.5 Å ) 62 or superoxo- (dO-O ≈1.2 Å -1.3 Å) 63  species of oxygen with bond length of less than 1.8 Å .

The high-energy peak shoulder observed in the experimental XAS spectra of Li2-xRuO3 obtained from the 4.2 VLi plateau cannot be explained by the presence of lattice oxygen vacancies.  The  simulated  O  K-edge  (Figure  2-1(a)  and  Figure  B6)  and  Ru  L3-edge (Figure 2-1(b) and Figure B7) of Li2-xRuO3-δ with δ = 0.25 oxygen vacancies per formula unit  in  the  bulk  led  to  additional  features  between  the t2g and eg peaks,  as  well  as  a significant decrease in the intensity of the eg relative to the t2g feature, which were not clearly experimentally observed (Figure 3-1(a), (b) and Figure B1). Moreover, we have also performed a test calculation on Ru L-edge XAS of a surface Ru atom surrounded by surface oxygen vacancies as in Figure b7(d), and a similar trend as the bulk oxygen vacancy calculations was also observed. Here, we saw a more intense feature between t2g and eg peaks and more depressed eg peaks due to larger degree of Ru reduction (Figure B7(d)), compared to the cases with bulk oxygen vacancies (Figure B7(a)). However, we cannot rule out the presence of oxygen vacancy formation as we have also observed a slight rise of the feature between eg and t2g, and this observation could potentially come from oxygen vacancies formed in the oxides upon charging, but the additional features at high photon energy cannot be solely explained by oxygen vacancy formation. Previous computational work on Li2-xRuO3 and Li2-xIrO3 showed the presence of distorted oxygen cages with an oxygen distance around 2.4 Å, 40, 43 and refined neutron diffraction data in chemically delithiated Li2-xIrO3 samples also confirmed an oxygen-oxygen distance of around 2.4 Å. 43  This O-O bond distance does not support the presence of true peroxide or superoxide species. We performed Ru L3-edge and O K-edge spectra simulations by reducing the oxygen-oxygen bond distance from 2.4 Å to 1.8 Å in Li0RuO3 where we forced two oxygen atoms closer together while keeping the position of other atoms the

same. This led to increased high-energy shoulder intensities for both Ru L3-edge and O K-edge,  indicating  a  stronger  oxygen-oxygen  coupling,  as  shown  in  Figure  B8  and Figure B9(a). However, a further reduction of the O-O bond distance from 1.8 Å to 1.2 Å, so as to form a true superoxide, led to a drastic reduction in the eg intensity compared to the t2g peak. This could be the result of reduced 𝜎 overlap between Ru 4 d and O 2 p states coming from a smaller O-Ru-O bond angle associated with shorter O-O bonds. As such  changes  were  not  observed  in  the  experimental  XAS  data  in  Figure  3-1,  the formation of peroxo-like and superoxo-like species with an O-O bond length less than 1.8 Å in bulk Li2-xRuO3 (1 ≤ x ≤ 2) is also not likely based on our combined experimental and simulated study.  Moreover, as we force the O-O bond distance from 2.4 Å to 1.8 Å and 1.2 Å, we induced an energy penalty of above 3 eV, which also indicates that from an  energetic  standpoint,  forming  such  short  O-O  bond  distance  in  Li2-xRuO3  is  not possible.

The oxygen-oxygen coupling in Li2-xRuO3 (1 ≤ x ≤ 2) is further supported by O K-edge valence XES, which probes the projected occupied local density of state (DOS) of the O 2 p orbital. The XES spectra of the pristine electrode in Figure 3-3(a) and Figure 3-3(b) consisted of three major features: one major peak centered at ≈523 eV and two shoulders located at ≈521 eV and ≈526 eV, respectively. When comparing these, on a binding energy  scale,  with  valence  band  XPS  data  from  Li2RuO3,  we  have  observed  similar features with different relative intensities because of different selection rules dictating valence  XES  and  XPS  (Figure  3-3(a)). 64 In  line  with  previous  work  on  perovskite materials that have comparable O K-edge XES spectra 64 , we assign the major XES peak

to  non-bonding oxygen, and the high- and low-energy shoulders to anti-bonding and bonding Ru-O bonds, respectively. 64  This assignment is supported by the DFT projected DOS of Ru 4 d and oxygen 2 p in Figure 3-3(a), where the high-energy shoulder reflects Ru-O bonding states (≈ 6 eV in the DOS) with a predominantly oxygen character, the low-energy shoulder reflects anti-bonding Ru-O states with mostly metal character (≈1 eV  in  the  DOS),  and  the  center  peak  indicates  non-bonding  oxygen  states  without significant contribution of Ru d -electrons (≈2.5 eV in the DOS). Here, we should note that  the  center  non-bonding  peak  position  of  computed  ground-state  DOS  had  some discrepancies with experimental O K-edge XES spectra (Figure 3(a)). When charging Li2-xRuO3 up to 3.8 VLi, there was no significant change observed for the O K-edge XES spectra  (Figure  3-3(b)),  in  agreement  with  corresponding  simulated  O  K-edge  XES spectra of Li2-xRuO3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) in Figure 3-3(c). The O K-edge XES indicates that there is  no oxygen participation upon first lithium removal. In contrast, upon charging Li2xRuO3  to  4.2  VLi  and  beyond  a  spectral  broadening  was  observed  (Figure  3-3(b)), indicative of changes to the probed oxygen states. This broadening was also found in the ab-initio calculated XES spectra of Li0.5RuO3 and Li0RuO3 (Figure 3-3(c)), especially for the oxygen non-bonding peak. Here, we should note that for OCEAN simulation of O K-XES, because no core-hole effect is considered, the energy is referenced to the Fermi level, and the relative energy scale is basically the same as the E-Ef scale. Using the crystal orbital overlap population (COOP), in line with previous work, 11, 41, 65-66 the broadening in the oxygen non-bonding feature can be attributed to an increased O-O antibonding character (by showing negative COOP intensity) in the energy range where we observed the broadening in computed spectra (from -2 eV to 0 eV vs. the Fermi level)

in Figure 3-4(d). Furthermore, by visualizing the charge density in the same energy range, we observed that the charge density also resembled a (O-O) 𝜎 ∗ interaction with a nodal plane in the middle as shown in Figure 3-3(d). This finding further supports the formation of oxygen-oxygen coupling upon charging Li2-xRuO3 in the high-voltage plateau of 4.2 VLi.  The  peak  broadening  in  the  XES  data  most  likely  came  from  the  (O-O) 𝜎 ∗ antibonding  states  (Figure  3-3(d)).  These  states  are  different  from  those  with  an additional 𝜋 * participation from Ru 4 d electrons which are responsible for the increased intensity at the high-energy shoulder found in the XAS spectra (Figure 3-2). Here, we captured the creation of both 'non-bonding' (O-O) 𝜎 ∗ in the O K-edge XES (Figure 33(d)) in contrast with 'anti-bonding' (O-O) 𝜎 ∗ with metal (Ru) 𝜋 * contribution in XAS, shown  in  the  charge  density  in  Figure  3-2(b).  Furthermore,  such  broadening  in  the experimental XES spectra was not observed in charged Li1-xCoO2 (Figure B11) and Li1xNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2  (Figure  B11).  Their  largely  unchanged  peak  widths  indicate  the absence of lattice oxygen-oxygen coupling (Figure 3-3(e)). However, broadening in the XES  spectra  was  observed  in  substituted  Li2-xRu1-yMyO3  such  as  Li2-xRu0.5Mn0.5O3 (Figure 3-3(e) and Figure B11) as well as Li2-xMnO3 derived materials including Li-rich and  Mn-rich  NMC  probed  by  RIXS, 36   where  the  central  peak  of  the  RIXS  spectra broadened upon charging. This broadening in O K-edge XES appears concurrently with changes  in  the  O  K-edge  absorption,  including  broadening  and  the  creation  of  an additional  feature  around  531  eV,  but  not  in  metal  L-edges  as  in  Ru  cases. 38 This observation is in agreement with previous COOP analysis performed by Saubanère et al . on  Li2MnO3, 11   where  upon  lithium  deintercalation,  a  stronger  O-O  coupling  exists, inducing (O-O) π and σ states. However, in contrast to the present Ru case, the (O-O) 𝜎 ∗

states of Li2MnO3 have no Mn contribution, 11  and therefore the additional states did not appear  in  Mn  L-edge  spectra  of  the  charged  electrodes  from  previous  experiemtnal measurement, where upon charging, the Mn L-edge spectra of Li2-xMnO3 did not show significant  change. 67 This  suggested  that  for  the  Ru-based  material,  the  (O-O) 𝜎 ∗ is stabilized through 𝜋 overlap with Ru d -manifolds because of the much more delocalized d states.  In  contrast,  for  the  Mn  scenario,  this  (O-O) 𝜎 ∗ is  not  coordinated  with  any transition  metal,  and  oxygen  is  released  because  of  more  weakened  metal  oxygen coordination. This observation suggests that strongly covalent Ru-O bonds are critical to enable lattice oxygen-oxygen coupling. 11, 41

Moreover, the broadening observed in the O K-edge XES spectra cannot be explained by the creation of oxygen vacancies in the structure as shown by the simulated O K-XES spectra of Li2-xRuO3-δ (δ=0.25) in Figure 3-3(c) and Figure B6, where only a small shift of the nonbonding peak towards lower energy was observed, whereas in the experimental spectra a positive shift was observed for Li2-xRuO3-δ upon charging. In addition, such broadening also cannot come from the formation of true peroxo- or superoxo- species with an O-O bond length less than 1.8 Å. Simulated XES spectra of Li0RuO3 with an equilibrium O-O bond distance of 2.4 Å and shortened distance of 1.8 Å and 1.2 Å in Figure B9(b) reveal distinctive new peak features in the simulated XES spectra for the 1.2 Å case, potentially coming from fingerprints of 𝜎, 𝜋, 𝜋 ∗ of the O-O bonding, which were clearly not observed experimentally in this case. Our experimental and simulated XAS and XES revealed unambiguous electronic structure signatures for lattice oxygen redox in the form of oxygen-oxygen coupling upon the first charge of Li2-xRuO3 on the

4.2 VLi plateau, which include 1) the growth of the eg peak shoulder in the O K-edge and Ru L3-edge XAS spectra originated from the (O-O) 𝜎 ∗ -like states with 𝜋 overlap with Ru d -manifolds and 2) the broadening of non-bonding oxygen originated from the (OO) 𝜎 ∗ states (without Ru d hybridization). Simulated XAS data further revealed that such O-O  coupling  in  Li2-xRuO3  has  an  oxygen-oxygen  distance  not  smaller  than  1.8  Å, namely,  much  longer  than  those  in  true  molecular  oxygen  dimers,  peroxide  and superoxide, which is in agreement with previous proposal by Doublet et al . 41 that the fully de-coordinated oxygen couples can escape from the lattice.

## 3.2.2 XAS Spectroscopy evidence of reductive coupling in Li2-xRuO3

We further examined the electronic structure signature for the reductive coupling in Li2- xRuO3, 11, 39, 41  in which the reduction of Ru is accompanied by the oxidation of lattice oxygen (or lattice oxygen-oxygen coupling) in the 4.2 VLi plateau. Upon charging Li2xRuO3 to 3.8 VLi, the ratio of the integrated peak intensities between the t2g and eg features, in  both  Ru  L3-edge  and  O  K-edge  XAS  spectra  (Figure  3-4(a)),  indicated  electron removal from the t2g states upon oxidation of Ru. This assignment is supported by the simulated Ru L3-edge (Figure 3-2(b)) and O K-edge XAS spectra (Figure B4) of Li2xRuO3 obtained from BSE calculations, which show the increase of the low-energy t2g peak relative to the high-energy eg peak with de-intercalation of one lithium per formula unit  from  Li2RuO3  to  LiRuO3.  Ru  oxidation  within  the  3.8  VLi  plateau  is  further evidenced by positive shifts in the edge photon energy of the Ru L3-edge (Figure 3-4(b)) and Ru K-edge XAS (Figure B13), greater energy splitting between t2g and eg features in Ru L3-edge XAS (Figure 3-4(b)) coming from larger ligand fields associated with higher oxidation states 54-56 , and shortened Ru-O bonds obtained from the extended X-

ray  absorption  fine  structure  (EXAFS)  analysis  of  the  Ru  K  edge  in  Figure  3-4(c), matching with previous observations from Mori et al . 58    Upon further charging within the 4.2 VLi plateau, the ratio of integrated peak intensities of t2g to eg features in both Ru L3-edge and O K-edge XAS spectra began to decrease (Figure 3-4(a)), accompanied by negative shifts in the onset energy of the Ru L3 edge (Figure 3-4(b)) and K edge (Figure B13), as well as a smaller energy splitting between t2g and eg features  in  Ru  L-edge XAS(Figure 3-4(b)), indicative of Ru reduction. The trend observed in the Ru L3-edge shift (Figure 3-4(b)) is consistent with other metrics to estimate Ru oxidation states used in previous work 68 . For example, the centroid and the pre-peak position of Ru L3-edge all shifted towards higher photon energies during charging up to 3.8 VLi, and towards lower energies at 4.2 VLi and above (Figure B16). Such trend of energy splitting between t2g and eg is also evidenced from the computed Ru L3-edge XAS spectra (Figure 3-2(a)) where as we remove the first Li + , the crystal field splitting increases slightly, and then decreases after removing the second Li +  per formula unit. Therefore, experimental Ru L3- and O K-edge XAS data of Li2-xRuO3 during the first charge along with simulated XAS spectra support the simultaneous Ru reduction and oxygen-oxygen coupling in the 4.2  VLi  plateau  reported  previously  as  reductive  coupling. 11,  39-40,  43 Similarly,  slight reduction of Ir has been reported by Hong et al. 47 using Ir L-edge XAS, accompanied by proposed lattice oxygen oxidation in fully de-intercalated Sn-substituted LixIrySn1-yO3 (x = 0, y = 0.5 and 0.75). 47 While the Ru oxidation state reduction in the 4.2 VLi plateau did not yield a statistically significant increase in the Ru-O bond length from Ru K-edge EXAFS (Figure 3-4(d)), the Debye-Waller factor ( 𝜎&lt;=&gt;? @ ) associated with the Ru-O bond

was increased markedly at 4.2 VLi and above, indicating increased variances of Ru-O bond length and angles as well as a distorted Ru-O cage, which requires further study.

(e) Non-bonding peak full width at halfmaximum  (FWHM)  as  a  function  of  charging  potential  of  different  positive  electrode materials: LiCoO2 (LCO), LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 (NMC), Li2RuO3 (LRO) and Li2Ru0.5Mn0.5O3(LRMO). The materials claimed to have anionic redox (closed symbol) were observed to have significant peak broadening upon charging in contrast with LCO and NMC (open symbol), which utilize predominantly cationic redox activity upon oxidation. Here,

the FWHM was extracted based on the width at the half height of the most predominant peak (non-bonding peak) as the other shoulder peaks are much smaller than the non-bonding peak, thus we assume that the shoulder peaks evolution will not have significant effect on the FWHM of the center non-bonding peak, the FWHM extraction procedure is also shown schematically in Figure B10. Raw XES data of LCO, NMC and LRMO is shown in Figure B11 and more detailed analysis is shown in Figure B12.

The  k-range  for  Fourier transformation is 1 Å  -1 to 11 Å  -1 . (d) Fitted Ru-O bond length (closed circle) and DebyeWaller factor ( 𝜎&lt;=&gt;? @ ) from Ru K-edge EXAFS shown in Figure 3-4(c). In the first plateau, Ru is monotonically oxidized with increasing t2g and eg splitting, accompanied by Ru-O bond contraction.  Upon  charging  to  4.2  VLi,  Ru  metal  is  slightly  reduced  with  less  t2g  and  eg splitting, and there is an increase in the Ru-O bond length and disorder in the system. The raw EXAFS data in k-space and fitting results are shown in Figure B14 and B15, and the summary of the EXAFS fitting parameter is shown in Table B1. Summary of alternative

EXAFS fitting parameter by only including the first coordination shell is shown in Table B2, where the trend of bond length and Debye-Waller factor matches with the result presented in Figure 3-4(d).

The XAS spectral evidence of reductive coupling at the 4.2 VLi plateau during the first charge was diminished in subsequent cycles. The voltage profile of Li2-xRuO3 in the subsequent charges was also markedly different from the first cycle. In fact, the first charge distinct voltage plateaus at 3.8 VLi and 4.2 VLi were replaced by a sloppy voltage profile with an average potential of around 3.6 VLi in subsequent cycles, as shown in Figure  3-5(a).  During  the  third  charge,  the  Ru  L3-edge  onset  energy  was  found  to increase monotonically with increasing lithium de-intercalation. This is in contrast to behavior during the first charge with first an increase and then a decrease in the edge onset  energy  (Figure  3-5(a)  and  Figure  3-4(b)),  characteristic  of  reductive  coupling (reduction  of  Ru)  with  an  enhanced  oxygen-oxygen  interaction.  This  observation suggests that reductive coupling, and potentially oxygen-oxygen coupling are substantially diminished in subsequent cycles, and Ru redox was largely responsible for reversible capacities. This postulate is supported by a much lower photon energy onset at  comparable lithium content in Li2-xRuO3 in the third charge (Figure 3-5(a) bottom panel) compared to the first charge (Figure 3-5(a) top panel). Further support comes from the  DEMS in  Figure  3-5(b),  where  an  irreversible  oxygen  redox  (oxygen  oxidation) generated oxygen in the first charge at around 4.2 VLi, but in subsequent cycles oxygen evolution fell below the detection limit. The amount of oxygen evolution can only be translated to an oxygen deficiency fraction of 0.02 mol/mol of oxides. From the DEMS measurement, we can also capture the first onset of CO2 evolution at ≈3.9 VLi, potentially because of residual Li2CO3 from the synthesis precursor. 69-70  Upon charging to 4.2 VLi,

lattice oxygen redox was accompanied by pronounced electrolyte oxidation to generate CO2 evolution (0.20 mole per mole of oxides), which was also reduced considerably in subsequent cycles. Previous online electrochemistry mass spectrometry measurements (OEMS) 4, 71  on NMC and Li-rich NMC has attributed part of the CO2 evolution to singlet oxygen  evolved  from  electrolyte  decomposition  at  the  cathode  surface.  Even  by attributing  all  the  CO2  evolution  (0.20  mol  per  mol  of  oxides)  to  the  oxide  lattice (although this is unlikely), we would only create around 0.4 mol of oxygen vacancies (0.8  mol  of  electron  transfer)  per  formula  unit  of  oxide  during  the  4.2  VLi  plateau. Accounting for the charge associated with the simultaneous Li-removal in this stage (≈ 0.8 mol Li +  and e - ),  oxygen and CO2 evolution alone cannot explain the reduction of transition metal within the high-voltage plateau observed in Ru L3- and O K-edge XAS in Figure 3-4 (a) and (b), and Figure 3-5(a) in the first charge.  As a result, during the first cycle, the redox process proceeded with Ru 4+/5+  accompanied by oxygen-oxygen coupling  and  transition  metal  reduction,  whereas  in  subsequent  cycles  the  high reversibility of Li2-xRuO3 most likely relied heavily on reversible Ru redox of Ru 3.x+ /Ru 5+ (where x is closer to 1 than 0), which surprisingly resembles the trends found in 3 d transition metal systems in both Li-rich and Na-ion compounds 37, 48

The lithium content was calculated based  on  the  current  applied  and  time  of  the  charge/discharge  process  and  the  charge transferred during the 5 h potential holding at the end-of-charge, which can be translate to how  many  lithium  ions  per  formula  unit  (de-)intercalate  upon  cycling.

- 3.2.3 Implications in oxygen redox reported for other oxides

The electronic  structure  signature  of  oxygen-oxygen  coupling  associated  with  lattice oxygen oxidation in Li2-xRuO3 revealed that the non-bonding oxygen is primarily being oxidized, 45  giving rise to characteristic features in the O K-edge and Ru L3-edge XAS as well as to the O K-edge XES. The oxidized non-bonding species can be formed through

oxygen sublattice distortion which also has a transition metal (Ru) coordination, where this  intermediate  O-O  dimer-like  species  can  be  stabilized  through  metal  oxygen covalency, 11,  40 in  contrast  with  Mn-based  oxides  exhibiting  anionic  redox. 47,  67 The electronic fingerprints and the physical origin proposed in this work can be applied to explain the spectroscopic data of Li-excess materials reported previously. For charged LixIrySn1-yO3, the appearance of an additional spectral feature, that is, at ≈523 eV in O K-edge XES and at ≈531 eV in O K-edge XAS, as well as the broadening of the eg feature (≈531 eV) for charged Li2IrO3, has been previously attributed to oxygen redox without any  specific  electronic  structure  details.  Similarly,  for  Li2MnO3  and  its  derivative materials  including  Li-rich  and  Mn-rich  NMC,  researchers  have  observed  similar increased intensities at the high-energy peak of ≈531 eV of O K-edge 36, 38 . This peak has been proposed to be the fingerprint of oxygen redox, but no specific physical origin has been assigned to it. On the basis of this work, this feature can be assigned to the 𝜋 / 𝜎 states of (O-O) bonding from enhanced oxygen coupling, providing electronic structure details for oxygen redox. While spectral changes of Ir L-edge XAS and O K-edge XAS spectra of LixIrySn1-yO3 are expected to be similar to those of Ru found in this work (Figure  3-1),  previous  Ir  L-edge  measurements 47,  72 suffered  from  significant  peak broadening because of the much shorter core-hole lifetime of Ir 73 and failed to detect any spectroscopic  changes.  High-energy  resolution  L-edge  XAS  is  critical  to  follow  any changes in such 4 d and 5 d transition metal oxides. Importantly, in Li2MnO3 67  and Lirich andMn-rich NMC 38 , even though similar changes have been observed in O K-edge spectra, no simultaneous broadening or additional peak is reported in the Mn L-edge upon  charging, 67 which  suggest  that  this  (O-O)  peroxo-like  state  did  not  have  any

metallic  contribution  and  is  therefore  more  prone  to  oxygen  evolution  compared  to metal-hybridized peroxo-like species as in Li2RuO3. Similarly, an emerging peak at ≈531 eV was observed in the O K-edge XAS of charged Li1.2Ti0.4 M 0.4O2 ( M = Fe, Mn) 74  and Li1.3Nb0.3 M 0.4O2 ( M =  Fe,  Mn) 75 ,  while  minimal differences were noted for transition metal L edges, 74-75  indicating that the (O-O) coupled states in these compounds are not hybridized with the transition metal, resulting in lower capacity retention compared to Ru and Ir-based materials.

The  observed  electronic  structure  fingerprints  for  oxygen  redox  in  Li2RuO3  and implications are discussed with respect to different proposed mechanisms for oxygen redox  in  the  literature.  The  finding  on  the  oxidation  of  non-bonding  oxygen  can  be related to the DFT studies of oxygen redox in Li2MnO3, Li2Ru0.5Sn0.5O3 and Li-excess disordered rock salt reported by Seo and Ceder, 45  where the oxidation of non-bonding oxygen  (the  oxygen  bound  to  Li)  was  proposed.    However,  similar  to  the  claim  of Tarascon, Doublet and coworkers claim, 11, 40   we argue that the strong hybridization between  Ru  and  O2 nis  critical  to  stabilize  the  oxidized  oxygen  species  otherwise oxygen-oxygen coupling would form molecular oxygen, causing capacity loss (irreversible  oxygen  redox).  In  addition,  transition  metal  migration  can  create  undercoordinated oxygen, which can facilitate the coupling between transition metal migration and oxygen redox in Li-rich and Mn-rich NMC (Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2) observed by Gent and Chueh. 38  Nevertheless, such oxygen, without transition metal coordination, is prone to be released and would not contribute to capacities in later cycles, as shown by hard XAS data from Hu et al. 37 , where the capacity contribution from the oxygen redox

of such materials is diminished to 50 mAh/g in the 83 rd  cycle compared to 120 mAh/g in the first cycle. 37 Moreover, we show that in such covalent oxides with a 4 d transition metal, even though stable (O-O) coupling can be formed in the first charge, the capacity attributed to oxygen redox can be overwhelmed by a more significant contribution from cation redox in subsequent cycles.

## 3.3 Conclusions

In this work, by combining O K-edge XAS, Ru L3-edge HERFD-XAS and O K-edge XES spectroscopy with ab-initio theoretically calculated spectra, we have captured and rationalized electronic structure fingerprints that reveal an enhanced O-O coupling in Li2-xRuO3 in the 4.2 VLi plateau during the first charge after removing ≈ 50 % of the lithium. This observation provides direct evidence central to lattice oxygen redox (O 2/(O2) n) in charged Li2-xRuO3 after Ru oxidation (Ru 4+ /Ru 5+ ). Such oxygen-oxygen coupling (lattice oxygen redox) of Li2-xRuO3 was also  accompanied with simultaneous Ru reduction that cannot be solely explained by oxygen vacancy formation in the oxides at high potentials. Upon the first charge, the lattice oxygen redox is accompanied by a small amount of O2 evolution in the first charge (captured by DEMS), which is diminished in subsequent cycles. This observation is in agreement with the changes in Ru L3-edge HERFD-XAS. Ru was found to be in a more reduced state in later cycles  despite  similar  lithium  content,  indicating  that  the  Ru  redox  contributed  more  to discharge capacities in later cycles than in the first cycle. This study has provided theoretical insights on previously reported spectroscopic features in resonant inelastic X-ray scattering spectroscopy and O K-edge XAS across the families of different materials exhibiting anionic redox. This work highlights the importance of combining with the state-of-the-art core-level measurements  and ab  initio excited-state  Bethe-Salpeter  equation  calculations  in  order  to interpret  the  spectroscopic  features.  The  presented  approach  can  be  used  as  a  transferable

framework to monitor the spectroscopy changes of metal oxides undergoing redox/electrochemical reactions for Li-ion and electrocatalysis applications.

## 3.4 Methods

## Experimental methods

Solid-state  synthesis The  pristine  Li2RuO3  was  synthesized  through  the  solid-state  route previously  undertaken  by  Goodenough  et  al. 76 and  Tarascon  et  al. 40   Li2CO3  and  RuO2 precursors are first dried under air flow at 300  o C for 4 h. The precursors were then mixed in stoichiometric amounts, but with a Li excess of 10 %, with a mortar and a pestle for 1 h in an argon-filled glovebox (&lt;0.5 ppm of H2O and O2). The resultant powder was pelletized under 8 tons and calcined and sintered at 1000 o C and 900 o C under air with a heating rate of 2 o C/min for 24 h and 48 h, respectively, with intermediate grinding. The phase purity of Li2RuO3 is confirmed through X-ray diffraction (XRD) with PANalyt'cal X'Pert PRO (Figure B18).

Positive electrode preparation The pellet electrode was prepared by pelletizing around 48 mg of active material using 6 mm diameter pressing die set (Across International) for 15 mins. The pellets were then sintered under air at 900 °C for 6 hours. The cooling and heating rates were 2 °C/min. The pellet electrodes were then broken into pieces of around 3 mg each and dried in vacuum under 120 °C overnight before being transferred into an Argon-filled glovebox (H2O, O2 &lt; 0.5ppm). The pellet electrodes were used for the X-ray measurements to remove any ambiguities introduced by conductive carbon and binder.

Composite electrodes were prepared by mixing active material (80 % mass fraction), 10 % acetylene  black  (AB)  and  10  %  polyvinylidene  fluoride  (PVDF)  (Kynar)  dispersed  in  N-

Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) with FRITSCH Minimill 23 homogenizer. The slurry was then blade-coated onto an aluminum sheet with a gap of 5 𝜇 m.  The composite electrodes were punched into 1/2' disc and pressed at 6.3 T cm -2  under a hydraulic press, to embed the powder into the aluminum disc. Finally, the electrodes were completely dried at 120 °C under vacuum for 12 h before being transferred into Argon-filled glovebox (&lt;0.5 ppm of H2O and O2). The active loading of the composite electrodes for the cycling experiments is around 3 mg/cm 2 . Composite electrodes for DEMS experiments were prepared with a slurry dispersed in less NMP to make a more viscous slurry. The resultant slurry was then blade-coated onto a stainless steel 304 mesh with an opening of 0.0012' with a wire diameter of 0.008' with an aluminum sheet underneath, and with a gap of 15 𝜇 m.. The electrodes were then dried and separated from the aluminum sheet underneath and punched into 15 mm diameter discs. The DEMS electrodes were pressed at 4.53 T cm -2  under a hydraulic press. Finally, the electrodes were completely dried at 120 °C under vacuum for 12 h before being transferred into an Argon-filled glovebox (&lt;0.5 ppm of H2O and O2). The active loading of the composite electrodes for the DEMS experiments was around 5.27 mg/cm 2 , which is higher than the loading of composite electrodes for XAS measurements to ensure that enough gaseous species were evolved to be detected during cycling.

Electrochemical  measurements Electrochemical  behavior  of  the  pellet  electrodes  was confirmed by galvanostatic measurements in two-electrode cells (Tomcell type TJ-AC). Cells were assembled in an argon-filled glovebox (&lt;0.5 ppm of H2O and O2) and comprised a lithium metal  foil  as  the  negative  electrode  and  the  positive  electrode,  separated  by  two  pieces  of polypropylene separator (2500 Celgard), impregnated with 150 μL of LP57 (1M LiPF6 in a 3:7

ethylene carbonate (EC): ethylmethyl carbonate (EMC) electrolyte (BASF)). After assembly, the cells rested for 6 h prior to measurement and then were charged with different end-ofcharge potentials (3.6 VLi, 3.8 VLi, 4.2 VLi, 4.4 VLi, and 4.6 VLi) at a rate of ≈1.64 mA/g. This rate  of  charge  corresponds  to  a  rate  of  C/100  based  on  the  theoretical  capacity  calculated assuming one lithium extraction per Li2RuO3. The cell was held at the end-of-charge potential for 5 h before disassembly inside the glovebox. The composite electrode was charged in a twoelectrode coin cell (Hohsen CR2016) with Li metal foil as the negative electrode. The positive and  negative  electrodes  were  separated  by  two  pieces  of  polypropylene  separator  (2500 Celgard), impregnated with 100 μL of LP57. The coin cells were charged at a rate of C/10 (16.35 mA/g) with different end-of-charge potential (first cycle: 3.6 VLi, 3.8 VLi, 4.2 VLi and 4.6 VLi, third cycle: 3 VLi, 3.4 VLi, 4 VLi, and 4.6 VLi). The cells were held at the end-of-charge potential  for  5  h  before  being  disassembled  inside  the  glovebox.  The  collected  pellets  and composite electrodes were rinsed in 1 mL EMC solution with stirring for 24 h to remove the residual  electrolyte  and  electrolyte  decomposition  products  on  the  surface.  The  pellets  and composite electrodes were then dried in vacuum for 4 h before further characterization using XAS and XES.

Differential  electrochemistry  mass  spectrometry  measurements The  DEMS  setup  was constructed in-house based on the design reported by McCloskey et  al. 77 and  used  for  the detection of gas evolution including CO2 and O2 in the head space of the electrochemistry cell along with pressure monitoring. Details on the DEMS setup and cell design are documented in Harding et al. 78  The cell volume is around 6.7 cm 3  for the measurement and Argon (Airgas, 99.999 % pure, O2, H2O, CO2 &lt; 1 ppm ) was used as a carrier gas. The DEMS cells were

prepared inside an argon-filled glovebox (&lt;0.5 ppm of H2O and O2) and comprised a lithium metal foil as the negative electrode and the DEMS positive electrodes, separated by two pieces of polypropylene separator (2500 Celgard), impregnated with 150 μL of LP57. The cell was first pressurized with argon to around 22 psi and allowed to rest for 8 h prior to electrochemical measurements  to  check  for  any  potential  leakage.  DEMS  measurement  started  4.5  h  after pressurization with a time interval of 10 min of collecting the gas from the headspace to obtain a CO2 evolution background from evaporated EMC fragments. The gas evolution profile upon charge/discharge  as  a  function  of  time  presented  in  this  work  was  already  backgroundsubtracted by fitting the gas evolution profile collected in the open-circuit voltage stage after pressurizing with a polynomial function. The electrochemical measurements were carried out at a current density of 16.35 mA/g (0.088 mA/cm 2 ) for charge and discharge (corresponding to a C/10 rate), and a time interval of 10 min was set between each DEMS sequence.

Synchrotron measurements After rinsing and drying, the dried pellet electrodes were mixed with sucrose or BN powder to make 10 mm pellets. The pellets were wrapped around with Kapton tape for protection during transportation for hard X-ray absorption measurements. High-energy resolution fluorescence detected Ru L3-edge XAS was conducted at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL) at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. The measurements were performed with a high-resolution tender x-ray spectrometer developed on a dispersive Johansson geometry in a 500 mm Rowland circle using a Si(111) analyzer. 79  The overall  Ru  Lα  emission  line  was  recorded  in  dispersive  mode  by  the  spectrometer;  for extracting the HERFD spectrum, the peak intensity of the Lα emission line is plotted as a function  of  the  incident  photon  energy.  By  using  the  Si(111)  monochromator  of  SSRL

beamline 6-2, an overall energy resolution of 0.6 eV was achieved enabling the sharpening of the Ru-L3 XAS features when compared to conventional x-ray absorption spectroscopy, that is, total fluorescence yield or transmission mode XAS  (comparison shown in Figure B19). The incident beam was about 400 μm x 800 μm (FWHM) and the photon flux ≈ 10 12  sec -1 . The dried electrode material was mixed with sucrose to minimize any self-absorption effects across the very intense Ru L3-edge resonances, resulting in pressed pellets with an active material mass fraction concentration of 0.5 %.

Ruthenium K-edge EXAFS was conducted at beamline 20-BM-B of the Advanced Photon Source  (APS)  at  the  Argonne  National  Laboratory  in  transmission  mode  with  an  active materials mass fraction of 10 %, diluted with boron nitride. A Ru metal foil was used as the reference. O K-edge XAS and XES were conducted at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) on beamline 8.0.2.  All spectroscopy data were normalized and processed using the ATHENA software package. 80

## Computational Methods

DFT calculations We used the Perdew-Burke-Enzerhof (PBE) 81  formulation of the density functional and projected augmented wave (PAW) potentials implemented in Vienna ab initio Simulation  Package  (VASP) 82-84 ,  with  Dudarev's  rotationally  invariant  Hubbard-type U 85 applied on the transition metal where we applied a Ueff = 4 eV on the Ru 4 d orbital as reported from previous work. 11, 45 A  k-point  per  reciprocal  atom  of  8000  was  used.  The  delithiated structures were generated with a primitive cell with a four formula unit of Li2RuO3, where for each different lithium content, the most energetically favorable configuration was taken. The

voltage profile calculated using the energetics from the delithiated structures is shown in Figure B5, where the computed voltage profile matched relatively well with the experimental charging curve. However, we should note that to compute the true ground-state at each lithium content along  the  convex  hull,  a  cluster  expansion  approach  should  be  employed. 86 The  surface calculations in Figure B7(d) were conducted with VASP using a stoichiometric slab model with slab thickness of 5 Å and a vacuum thickness of 10 Å to avoid any spurious interactions across the periodic boundary. For simplicity, a surface orientation of (001) was chosen for the test, and a k-point grid of 7 × 7 × 1 was used. We fully relaxed the surface structure before the OCEAN calculations.

The XAS and XES simulations were performed with the OCEAN 2.5.2 code  50   51 ,  which combines ground-state DFT and the BSE to account for the core-hole presence and to properly capture the spin-orbit interactions of transition metals. The ground-state charge density and wave functions used in the core-hole screening and BSE calculations were obtained using Quantum Espresso. 87  Norm-conserving pseudopotentials from the ABINIT 88  distribution were used. The k-point grid used to solve the Kohn-Sham states was typically 6×6×3 for the pristine Li2RuO3 (24 atom cell). Similar values were used for all structures. The screening calculations used a 2×2×2 k-point grid. The number of unoccupied bands used for the BSE calculation was 250,  and  the  screened  core-hole  potential  calculation  included  750  bands.  A  spectral broadening of 0.5 eV was applied, and dipole and quadrupole transitions were considered. To enable easy spectroscopic feature comparison, the core-level shift was not turned on for the OCEAN calculations. Given the polycrystalline type of our samples, all simulated spectra were obtained by averaging the contribution from all photon polarizations.

## Chapter 4 : Enhanced cycling of Ni-rich positive electrodes by fluorine modification

## 4.1 Introduction

LiNixMnyCozO2 (NMC) is widely used for the positive electrodes of Li-ion batteries, where increasing  the  Ni  contents  from  LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2  (NMC111)  to  Ni-rich  NMC  such  as LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 (NMC 622) and LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811) significantly increases the  discharge  capacity 1-3 ,  yet  have  a  tradeoff  of  reduced  cycling  stability 1-5 and  thermal stability 3,6,7 ,  with  lower  onset  potentials  of  CO2  and  O2  fromation 1,2,8 , The reduced cycling stability comes from the surface electronic structures of the oxides. 9,10 Previous computational 9,11 and experimental studies 10,12  have shown that the dissociation of carbonate electrolyte solvent in electrolyte becomes more favorable on NMC with increasing Ni content (increased M-O covalency), forming surface hydroxyl group ( e.g. C3O3H3 + -Osurface and H + -Osurface), and reducing surface transition metals. 9-12  The surface hydroxyls group can further attack the LiPF6 salt, generating decomposed salt species such as LixPFyOz and PF3O probed by ex situ fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) as well as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy  (XPS).  The  decomposed  species  deposited  on  the  surface  contribute  to  the impedance growth on the electrode surface, rationalizing the decreased cycling performance observed experimentally for Ni-rich NMC 1,4,5  compared to NMC111 1  and LiCoO2 13 . Recent density  functional  theory  (DFT)  screening  work  by  Giordano et  al. 9 has  shown  that  the compounds with ligand p-band further away from the Fermi level such as Al2O3 and NiF2, demonstrated much lower driving force for carbonate oxidative dehydrogenation. Such trend is  in  agreement  with ex  situ 14 and in  situ 12   FT-IR  work  on  Al2O3-coated  NMC622  has demonstrated much less carbonate decomposition as well as salt decomposition, in comparison to uncoated NMC622. Moreover, such depressed solvent and salt decomposition are shown to

be coupled with enhanced cycling stability of the Al2O3-coated NMC622 15-18  with less internal resistance  build-up,  compared  to  uncoated  oxides. 15-18 Further  support  comes  from  recent work of Janek and coworkers 19  as well Xiong et al. 20  , where 1% - 4% fluorine doping of NMC811, using PvDF as a fluorinating agent, results in more stable cycling yet with less discharge capacity compared to pristine NMC811 upon charging to 4.2 Vgraphite with graphite as the negative electrodes with 0.5 C rate (~14 mA/g). This enhanced cycling performance of F-doped  NMC811  is  in  contrast  with  less  stable  cycling  of  N-doped  NMC81,  rooted  in difference in the surface electronic structures of F- and N-doped oxides, where F has a larger electronegativity  compared  to  O  and  N,  resulting  in  lower  ligand  p-band  and  less  surface reactivity and more stable interface. Unfortunately, the detailed interface reaction between the F-modified  electrode  and  carbonate-based  electrolyte  is  not  well  understood,  while  those previous works mainly focus on the evolution of oxide structures upon cycling, probed by Xray  diffractometry  (XRD)  as  well  as  scanning  electron  microscopy  (SEM).  More  recently, Gasteiger et al. 21  have shown that heat-treated NMC811 to remove surface impurity phases such as carbonates results in enhanced cycling stability, which arises questions to the role surface of F modification on reducing electrolyte oxidation and increase cycling stability as the surface modification processes involve heat-treatment at the temperatures high enough to remove surface impurity phases. Moreover, the root cause for the improved cycling stability of F-modified NMC is also not clearly pointed out, inhibiting further optimization of anionic substitution strategies to improve the cycling performance of Ni-rich NMC positive electrodes.

In this work, we have used one-pot solid-state synthesis of F-modified NMC811, which shows increased  cycling  stability  in  comparison  to  pristine  NMC.  By  employing in  situ FT-IR,

coupled with XPS, we probe a much more depressed signal coming from vinylene carbonates and dehydrogenated EC from C=O region in FT-IR and C1s and O1s spectra in XPS, typical parasitic  products  from  carbonate  decomposition.  Furthermore,  comparing  the  F-modified NMC811 with the heat-treated and as-received NMC811, we are able to decouple the impact of fluorine surface modification in NMC from that of Li2CO3-like surface contaminants on the cycling performance, highlighting the importance of surface electronic structure engineering of oxides materials on the cycling performance of positive electrodes and Li-ion batteries.

## 4.2 Result and Discussion

4.2.1 Fluorine substitution lowers the ligand p-band and dehydrogenation driving force

DFT calculations shows substituting oxygen with fluorine in LiNiO2 lower the overall ligand p band  with  respect  to  the  Fermi  level,  correlated  with  reduced  carbonate dehydrogenation  driving  force  for  fluorine  substituted  LiNiO2  in  comparison  with LiNiO2. By replacing half of the oxygen anion in the bulk LiNiO2, the ligand p band center  downward  shifts  away  from  the  Fermi  level  in  comparison  with  the  pristine LiNiO2, as shown in Figure 4-1(a) and (b). This ligand p-band downward shifts comes from a more electronegative ligand fluorine as well as Ni reduction by substituting O 2to F -, resulting in higher energy barrier for electron transfer from the electrolyte. (Figure 4-1(a)) Such downward shift of bulk ligand p-band corresponds to a upward shift of the Fermi level on the absolute energy scale, can potentially result in higher energy penalty of hydrogen adsorption based on the trend established in our previous work 9 , which is scaled with energy penalty for carbonate oxidative dehydrogenation. 11,22  (Figure 4-1(b)) By substituting 12.5% F -  on the (10 1 F 4) surface of LiNiO2 to lower the surface ligand p-

band, there is a 0.5 eV decrease of the carbonate dehydrogenation driving force on the oxide surface, resulting in more stable oxide-electrolyte interface. (Figure C1)

We  used  a  one-pot  solid-state  synthesis  to  experimentally  incorporate  F  into  the NMC811 lattice at 600  o C, where we used NH4F as the fluorinating agent as well as LiOH to compensate for the lithium loss during the fluorination. (Detailed procedures outlined in Methods section) Energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) showed largely uniform distribution of fluorine ions within and across particles with some concentrated spots  for  fluorine,  signaling  the  formation  of  metal  fluorides  on  the  particle  surface (Figure 4-2(a)).  However, due to the detection limit of EDX measurement (typically above 5%), we could not obtain a reliable estimation of the overall F-contents for Fmodified NMC811 from EDX. The average incorporation of fluorine into the surface is around 4-5%, from XPS high-energy resolution survey (Table C1), matching with the initial concentration of fluorinating agent introduced during synthesis. Further optimization of the synthesis route with longer mixing time could be achieved in future studies to achieve a better homogeneity in particle. Moreover, upon heat treatment to 600  o C under oxygen, there is also an obvious removal of surface carbonyl group from the  as-received  NMC811,  shown  by  XPS  C1s  of  the  as-received  and  F-modified NMC811 (Figure  4-2(b)).  Upon  fluorination  at  600 o C,  there  is  a  decrease  of  highbinding energy feature, marking the removal of surface carbonate and carbonyl group (O-C=O) during the heat-treatment. F1s XPS spectra of F-modified NMC811 shows successful incorporation of fluorine on the oxides, showing major contribution of metal (oxy-)fluorides in comparison with as-received NMC811.

Figure  4-1: (a)  Projected  density  of  states  (pDOS)  of  LiNiO2  (top  panel)  and  substituted LiNiOF (bottom panel), where by fluorine substitution there is an obvious reduction of the Ni by substituting O 2-   with F - ,  which also shifts the ligand band center downwards due to the larger electronegativity of F compared to O. The Ni 3d, O 2p and F 2p density of states are represented by grey, red and blue shades, respectively. (b) Hydrogen adsorption energy on the materials surface plotted against bulk ligand p band center (eV), where from the trend we established with other materials in previous work 9 , by fluorination, we are able to push down the ligand p-band, decrease the hydrogen adsorption energy and carbonate dissociation driving force.

4.2.2 In situ IR shows evidence of diminished solvent decomposition on charged F-modified NMC In  situ IR  shows  that  charged  F-modified  NMC811  exhibits  less  electrolyte  solvent dehydrogenation upon charging to 4.8 VLi, in comparison to pristine NMC811 as well as heat-treated NMC811. Attenuated total reflectance (ATR) spectra is composed of three major  peaks  in  the  C=O  region  of  pristine  LP57  electrolyte  (1  M  LiPF6  in  ethylene carbonate (EC):ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) solution) (Figure 4-3), located at around ~1807,  ~1773,  and  ~1744  cm -1 ,  which  can  be  attributed  to    C=O  stretching  of  EC molecule,  Li+-coordinated  EC  molecule,  and  EMC  molecule,  respectively.  This

assignment is based on the comparison of the ATR spectra of EC, EMC and 1 M LiPF6 in EMC solution from our previous work. 10,12  Upon charging the as-received NMC811 particle up to 3.8 VLi and above, there is an obvious growth of a convoluted feature in 1800 cm -1  to 1830 cm -1  wavenumber in the difference IR spectra (Figure 4-3(b)). This convoluted feature is composed of peaks at 1830 cm -1 10,12 , 1820 cm -1 10,12 , 1813 cm -1 10,12 , which corresponds to C=O stretching of vinylene carbonate (VC), EC-based oligomers, dehydrogenated EC, respectively. 10,12  The growth of those EC-derivative species comes from the dehydrogenation of EC molecules on the oxide surface, forming dehydrogenated EC. The dehydrogenated EC adsorbed on the surface could continue from EC-based oligomeric species with other  chain  carbonate-derived  species  in  the electrolyte. 10,11  Moreover, the formation of VC species could come from removing two hydrogen atoms from the EC molecules through oxide mediation and/or attack of singlet oxygen  from  the  electrolyte. 10,23,24 Those  decomposition  products  signal  the  intense interfacial reactions between as-received NMC811  and  conventional carbonate electrolyte. In comparison, the difference IR spectra of F-modified NMC811 (Figure 43(a)) shows minimum changes upon charging up to 4.8 VLi. (Figure 4-3(b)) The minimal spectra  changes  suggest  minimal  surface  reactivity  of  F-modified  NMC811  towards electrolyte, which is maintained after 3 cycles (Figure C2). This observation indicates stable oxide surfaces upon cycling towards carbonate dissociative adsorption (C3O3H4 + 2  O-M 3+ -O à *C3O3H3 +   +  *H + +  2  O-M 2+ -O) 10,11 .  This in  situ FT-IR  spectra  of  Fmodified  NMC811 is  comparable  to  that  of  NMC111  measured  in  previous  work 12 , showing negligible interface reactivity upon three cycles, much less reactive compared to  as-received  NMC622 and 811. 12 It  is  worthy  to  note  that  the  lack  of  decomposed

species observed for F-modified NMC811 in the IR only indicates a more diminished interfacial reactivity compared to as-received NMC811 at the same scale rather than a fully depressed interfacial reactions. The observed suppressed electrolyte decomposition for F-modified NMC811 presented in this work is also in agreement with the improved capacity retention of F-doped NMC811 upon charging to 4.3 -4.4 VLi shown by Janek et al. 19 , Xiong et al. 20 , as well as Breddemann et al. 25 through solid-state, sol-gel and gasflow reactor synthesis.

By  contrasting  to  heated-treated  NMC  811,  we  showed  that  the  reduced  electrolyte oxidation  of  F-modified  NMC811  does  not  solely  come  from  the  effect  from  heattreatment. By heat-treating the NMC811 at 600  o C without any fluorine source and Li compensation, heat-treated NMC811 were found to be free of carbonate contaminates as blank  sample  for  comparison  as  shown  by  the  XPS  C1s  data.  (Figure  4-4(c)).  Heattreated NMC811 shows noticeable increase in the overpotential compared to pristine NMC811  as  well  as  fluorine-modified  NMC811  (Figure  4-3(c)),  indicative  of  Lideficient phases formed on the oxide surface due to the heat treatment. Upon charging the heat-treated NMC811 up to 4.0 VLi and above, in  situ IR spectra (Figure 4-3 (c)) revelated  growing  signal  at  ~1830  cm -1 ,  indicative  of  VC  formation  but  without dehydrogenated EC and EC-based oligomeric species located at ~1813 cm -1 , 1820 cm -1 , respectively.  This  species  could  not  come  from  the  EMC-derived  species,  as  C=O stretching mode in linear carbonate usually located around and below 1750 cm -1 , 10  as demonstrated in our previous work.  10  This observation suggests innate NMC811 oxide surface  without  Li2CO3  contaminants,  specifically  the  oxygen  sites,  promotes  the

formation VC, generated from EC by removing two hydrogen atoms and forming a C=C double bond. (C3O3H4 + 2 O-M 3+ -O à *C3O3H2 + 2*H +  + 2 O-M 2+ -O) 23

On the other hand, we propose that surface carbonate Li2CO3 present on as-received NMC811, without heat-treatment, promotes the formation of deH-EC and EC-derived oligomers.  This  hypothesis  is  supported  by in  situ IR  spectra  of  composite  Li2CO3 electrodes  undergoing  a  linear  voltage  sweep.  Upon  charging  Li2CO3  to  3.9  VLi, significant decomposition current up to 20 µA was found, which was accompanied with increased  signal  ~1813  cm -1 ,  signalizing  the  growth  of  dehydrogenated  EC 10,12 and oligomeric  species 10,12 on  the  surface  of  Li2CO3  (Figure  4-3(d)).  The  decomposition current of Li2CO3 was accompanied with the conversion of Li2CO3 into CO2, evidenced by  the  differential  electrochemistry  mass  spectrometry  (DEMS)  of  Li2CO3.  Upon charging  Li2CO3  composite  electrode  to  3.9  VLi  and  above,  CO2  evolution  was accompanied  with  minimum  oxygen  evolution  (Figure  C14),  and  the  rate  of  CO2 evolution was roughly half of the electron transfer calculated by the coulomb counting from the decomposition current. There are generally two schools of thoughts in how Li2CO3 decompose upon charging to 3.9 VLi and above. The first school of thought proposes  that  upon  charging,  Li2CO3 decomposition  follows  the  electrochemical pathway 26-29 :  2Li2CO3 -&gt; 4e - +4Li + +2CO2+O2, which evolves CO2 and 0.5 O2 per 2e transferred. This previous work claimed the oxygen evolved from the electrochemical decomposition is the highly reactive singlet oxygen, shown by singlet oxygen trap 9,10 -dimethylanthracene (DMA). 27  Such singlet oxygen is shown in previous studies to attack the carbonate electrolyte and form CO2 23 . Therefore the singlet oxygen usually could not

be  captured  by  the  DEMS  measurement. 23,24   However,  in  the  DEMS  measurements presented in this and previous work, there is only one CO2 evolved per 2e -  transferred without additional O2 and CO2 evolution observed, supposedly coming from the singlet oxygen.  Moreover,  the  singlet  oxygen  trap  DMA  used  in  this  study 27   oxidizes electrochemically (C6H14-&gt;C6H13 + +e - ) upon charging to 3.9 VLi and above (Figure C15), and therefore cannot be a reliable singlet oxygen indicator at 3.9 VLi and above, which weakens the support for the school of thoughts.  27  Another school of thoughts propose that carbonates chemically decompose through an acid-base reaction 21 : 4H + +2Li2CO3 -&gt; 4Li + +2CO2+2H2O,  where  such  decomposition  only  has  CO2 release  without  any  O2 release, matching with previous DEMS measurement on the absence of O2 signal upon charging Li2CO3. 21,27  the protons could either come from protic species in the pristine electrolyte 21 as  well  as  the  protons  coming  from  the  dehydrogenation  of  electrolyte solvent  at  high  potentials,  supported  from in-situ IR  (Figure  4-3(d)).  Therefore,  we believe that the surface Li2CO3 decomposes in the form of acid-base reaction with the protons  provided  by  carbonate  electrolyte  decomposition  with  the  formation  of oligomeric species, as observed by in situ IR measurement (Figure 4-3(d)).

In situ FT-IR spectra of composite Li2CO3 undergoing a linear voltage sweep with a scan rate of 0.12 mV/sec. Upon charging, asreceived NMC811 shows significant decomposition starting from 4 VLi of ethylene carbonate decomposition including vinylene carbonate (VC), EC-based oligomers, dehydrogenated EC located at around 1830 cm -1 , 1820 cm -1 , 1813 cm -1 . In contrast, F-modified NMC811 shows absence of the decomposition of carbonate when compared in the same scale. For the heattreated NMC811 sample, there is only a signature of VC formation at 1830 cm -1  starting from 4 VLi, whereas for Li2CO3 composite electrodes, there is only obvious signal of dehydrogenated EC at 3.9 VLi and above.

## 4.2.3 Ex situ XPS shows evidence of reduced solvent and salt decomposition on charged Fmodified NMC

Further  support  for  reduced  electrolyte  decomposition  of  F-modified  NMC811  came from the ex situ XPS C1s and O1s of the charged F-modified NMC811 as shown in

Figure 4-4(a) and 4-4(d), which were collected from oxide-only electrodes charged to discrete voltages at rate of 2.8 mA/g (C/100), followed by 5 h potential holding. The C1s spectra (Figure 4-4(a)) were fitted to components including adventitious carbon or C-H bonds (285.0 eV), 30  C-O 31  bonds in ROLi (286.3 eV), 32  polyethers or R-CH2-OCO2Li species (287.6), 33,34  C=O/O-C-O bonds (288.8 eV) 31,35  like in acetals, and O=C-O 31  as in esters or carboxylates, 32  respectively. Charging the F-modified NMC811 to 4.6 VLi resulted  in  negligible  changes  in  the  C1s  spectra,  which  is  in  contrast  to  significant changes  observed  to  C-O  bonding  from  the  oligomeric  species  from  electrolyte decomposition upon charging as-received NMC811 (Figure 4-4(b)) reported previously. 10 The  enhanced  stability  of  charged  F-modified  NMC811  to  as-received NMC811 is further supported by O1s XPS spectra upon charging to 4.6 VLi,(Figure 44(d)) where minimum changes were noted in the intensity of lattice oxygen peak at ~529 eV as well as ~533.4 eV for the O-C=O bond in esters. In contrast, charging as-received NMC811 to 4.2 VLi and above, there was a significant increase in the C-O component in the C1s (Figure 4-4(e)), coupled with significant reduction in lattice oxygen peak in O1s (Figure 4-4(a)), which is in agreement with previous work. 10  This observation can be attributed to the formation of oligomers such EC-based and VC-based oligomer from oxidative dehydrogenation of EC and EMC solvent, later deposited on the oxygen lattice. 1,2

Reduced solvent oxidation of F-modified NMC811 is accompanied with reduced salt decomposition, revealed by ex situ XPS F1s spectra, shown in Figure 4-5(a) , (d), and Figure  4-6(a).  F1s  of  pristine  F-modified  NMC  surface  shows  predominantly  the

contribution  of  metal  (oxy-)fluorides  at  around  685  eV 32 ,  indicative  of  no  obvious surface residual of reaction precursors. While charging F-modified NMC811 to 4.1 VLi was accompanied with growing signal at around 686.5 eV as well as 687 eV.  32  (Figure 4-5(d)) Further charging up to 4.6 VLi resulted in no significant changes in the relatively intensities of these features. These components can be assigned to metal (oxy-)fluorides (LiMxFyOz) at 685 eV 32  from, lithiated fluorophosphates (LixPFyOz) at ~686.5 eV 32  for, as well as the residual electrolyte salt LiPF6 for ~687 eV 32 . Therefore, by charging from the pristine state to 4.1 VLi predominantly result in a slight attachment of electrolyte salt LiPF6 on the electrode surface at around 687 eV, and salt decomposition products such as lithiated fluorophosphates (LixPFyOz) at ~686.5 eV, accompanied with no significant intensity change in the metal oxyfluorides on the native oxides. Further charging up to 4.6 VLi does not result in significant changes  in the components  of  lithiated fluorophosphates (686.5 eV), metal (oxy-)fluorides (685 eV)  and the residual salt (687 eV) on the oxide surface, indicative of very stable fluorides later and no continued salt decomposition at high state-of-charge for the oxides. The stable fluoride layer on Fmodified NMC811 at high state-of-charge was further confirmed with lack of obvious shift observed in N2p XPS spectra with increasing voltage (Figure 4-5(f)) and minimum changes  in  the  peak  relative  intensity  in  P2p  XPS  spectra.  (Figure  C9))    Pristine  Fmodified NMC811 has a Ni2p peak around 855.4 eV, in comparison with 854.5 eV for pristine nonmodified NMC811, representing the existence of nickel (oxy-)fluorides on the  surface  introduced  by  the  synthesis. 10   Further  charging  of  F-modified  NMC811 reveals no shift in Ni2p main peak, suggesting stable nickel (oxy-)fluoride layers charged to 4.6 VLi. This observation is in line with minimum changes in the relative intensity of

the  phosphates,  metal  (oxy-)fluorophosphates  and  PF6  components  in  the  P2p  XPS spectra (Figure C9) spectra in F-modified NMC811 charged to 4.6 VLi.

In contrast to the reduced salt decomposition and stable fluoride layers observed in Fmodified NMC811, charged as-received NMC811 (Figure 4-5(b) and (e)) shows drastic electrolyte salt decomposition and strong surface reactivity as a function of potential as shown in our previous work. 10  Upon charging the as-received NMC811 to 4.2 VLi, there is significant growth of components at ~685 eV and ~686.5 eV as reported previously 10 , representing  salt  decomposition  into  metal  (oxy-)fluorides 32 and  fluorophosphates 32 . Further charging up to 4.6 VLi results significant decrease of components ~685 eV and ~686.5 eV, marking the decomposition of metal (oxy-)fluorides and fluorophosphates at high  state-of-charge,  potentially  attributed  to  further  decomposition  of  LixPFyOz  into gaseous products such as PF3O. 36     This  observation  indicates  a  unstable  salt-derived layers in charged as-received NMC811. Ni2p spectra of charged as-received NMC811 further  supported  the  observation  that  unstable  electrolyte  salt-derived  layers  on  the oxide surface. Upon charging to 4.2 VLi, a positive shift of the Ni2p main peak by 2 eV from 854.5 eV to 857  - 588 eV was observed, representing salt decomposition forming nickel  oxyfluorides  on  oxide  surface. 10 Further  charging  to  4.6  VLi  is  followed  by  a backshift of Ni2p spectra, indicative of the unstable salt-derived layers at high state-ofcharge. (Figure 4-5(e))

XPS C1s and F1s spectra of the heat-treated NMC811 and Li2CO3 further supports the reduced solvent and salt decomposition of F-modified NMC811 do not solely come from

the removal of surface impurities from heat-treatment. Charged heat-treated NMC811 to 4.6 VLi does not show significant growth of C-O component at 286.3 eV in the XPS C1s spectra (Figure 4-5(c)), indicative of lack of oligomeric species and dehydrogenated EC, matching with the lack of 1813 cm -1  and 1817 cm -1  spectroscopic features in charged heat-treated NMC811 in Figure 4-3(c). In contrast, XPS C1s spectra of charged Li2CO3 showed the growth of C-O component upon charging to 4.0 VLi and above, (Figure C16(a) and  Figure  4-6(d))  suggesting  the  formation  of  EC-based  oligomers,  coming  from dehydrogenated  EC.  This  observation  further  confirms  the  observation  that  surface contaminants such as carbonates are responsible for the formation of deH-EC and EC oligomers, while metal oxides are responsible for the VC formation, supported by in situ IR  spectra  of  charged  heat-treated  NMC811  (Figure  4-3(c)).  Both  VC  and  deH-EC formation generate surface hydroxyl group and protic species, which further attack the salt: H2Ooxide + PF5 =&gt;  PF3O  +  2HF,  forming  less fluorine coordinated salt decomposition species, observed in F1s of the charged Li2CO3 (Figure C16(c) and Figure 4-6(d))  and  heat-treated  NMC811  (Figure  4-5(c))  to  4.2  VLi  and  above.  The  atomic percent  of  salt  decomposed  product  LixPFyOz  and  metal  (oxy-)fluorides  (LiMxFyOz) observed for charged heat-treated NMC811 is around 20% at 4.2 VLi and above (Figure 4-6(b) and (c)), matching with the atomic percent of salt decomposition species observed in  charged  as-received  NMC811  in  previous  work, 10   further  suggesting  the  heattreatment solely does not result in the stable salt decomposition observed in F-modified NMC811.

## 4.2.4 F-modified NMC811 shows enhanced cycling stability compared to as-received NMC811 and heat-treated NMC811

The reduced interfacial reactivity of F-modified NMC811 results in improved cycling performance compared to nonmodified NMC811 and heat-treated NMC811. (Figure 47) The initial discharge capacity of F-modified NMC811 is around 170 mAh/g when cycled between 4.4 VLi and 2 VLi at a rate of 1C rate (280 mA/g), slightly lower compared to  that  of  nonmodified  NMC811,  potentially  due  to  removal  excess  Li  on  the  oxide surface  due  to  heat-treatment  and  introduction  of  fluorine.  Upon  cycling  F-modified NMC811 to 4.4 VLi, in a half-cell configuration with a 1C rate (280 mA/g), achieving a

capacity retention of 94% after 100 cycles, in comparison with less than 70% capacity retention  of  as-received  NMC811.  This  improvement  is  also  manifested  in  the  slow internal resistance buildup throughout the cycling of the F-modified NMC811, with less than 100 Ohm internal resistance upon charging to 50 cycles, in comparison with more than 150 Ohm of internal resistance of as-received NMC811 after 50 cycles. (Figure C20) However, the internal resistance development rate of the F-modified NMC811 start to catch  up  with  that  of  unmodified  NMC811  after  50  cycles,  indicative  of  potential  F removal on the surface and/or the overwhelming effect of Li negative electrodes in the half-cell configuration. This change of internal resistance growth rate build-up is also evident  in  the  cycling  profile,  where  F-modified  NMC811  starts  to  show  a  drastic increase  of  degradation  rate  after  50  cycles,  which  is  comparable  to  that  of  the  asreceived NMC811.

The greater cycling stability of F-modified NMC811 is less evident when compared to that of heat-treated NMC811. The heat-treated NMC811, cycled in the same condition with the F-modified NMC811, shows slightly worse cycling performance in the first 50 cycles, but still much improved performance compared to as-received NMC811 samples. After  50 th cycles,  the  degradation  rate  of  F-modified  NMC811  and  the  heat  treated NMC811 is  quite  similar.  This  similar  degradation  might  come  from  impact  of  the lithium  negative  electrodes  and/or  the  cross  talk  between  positive  and  negative electrodes, and to separate the impact from Li negative electrodes, further study and evaluation on full-cell performance of F-modified is needed.

Figure 4-7: Capacity retention of 5% F-modified NMC811, heat-treated NMC811, and asreceived NMC811 cycled between 4.4 VLi and 2 VLi with a current rate of 280 mA/g (1 C) and a constant current constant voltage (CCCV) cut-off upon charging with a threshold current of C/20  (14  mA/g),  where  F-modified  NMC811  shows  improved  capacity  retention  in comparison with heat-treated NMC811 and NMC811, yet after 50 cycles, there is decay in all those  three  materials  with  comparable  rate,  potentially  due  to  the  impact  from  negative electrodes. The electrodes loading is around 2-3 mg/cm 2 . The cycling data is reproduced with two coin cells with comparable loading, and the shaded area indicate the standard deviation of those two cells.

## 4.3 Conclusions

In  this  work,  we  have  shown  a  fluorine  modification  of  NMC811  positive  with  enhanced cycling stability. Upon fluorine doping, we are able to decrease the energetic driving force of carbonate  dehydrogenation  on  the  oxide  surface.  Such  reduced  solvent  decomposition  is further  supported by in  situ IR and ex  situ XPS measurement C1s and O1s spectra on the charged fluorine modified NMC811. This diminished solvent decomposition is coupled with stable salt decomposition layer deposited on the oxide layer, shown by XPS F1s spectra. By comparing the IR spectra with the heat-treated NMC811 and Li2CO3 composite electrodes, we are able to decouple the formation of VC and dehydrogenated EC, where oxides trigger the formation of VC in the solution phase, and metal carbonate impurities triggers the formation of  dehydrogenated  EC.  In  this  work,  we  highlight  the  importance  of  anion  engineering  in

controlling the cycling stability of high-energy positive electrodes, moreover we emphasize the  importance  of  Ni-rich  NMC  washing  and  pre-treatment  to  eliminate  potential  surface contamination and capacity degradation upon cycling.

## Experimental methods

Oxide synthesis and Electrode preparation F-modified NMC811 is synthesized by mixing stoichiometric amount of NH4F and LiOH H2O with the pristine NMC811 (EcoPro, South Korea) inside the glovebox in mortar and pestle for 1 h. The mixture is then heated in an oxygen flow at 600  o C for 4 h with a heating and cooling rate of 2 o C/min. The heat-treated NMC811 is processed by heating the pristine NMC811 (EcoPro, South Korea) in an oxygen flow at 600 o C for 4 h with a heating and cooling rate of 2 o C/min. By introducing 1%- 5% fluorine source, 5% of fluorine substitution resulted in the most improved cycling stability after 100 cycles (Figure C21), therefore in the study we primarily present the 5% F-modified NMC811 result.

In this study, we employed oxide-only electrodes since using composite electrodes hinders extraction of useful information on solvent decomposition products in C1s (due to conductive carbon) and salt decomposition products in F1s (due to binder) in XPS. By using oxide-only electrodes,  we  can  directly  correlate  the  surface  decomposition  products  and  interfacial reactivity with the oxide electronic structure without the interference of carbon and binder. The carbon-free binder free electrodes were prepared by mixing active materials with N-methyl-2pyrrolidone (NMP) (Sigma Aldrich) in a 1:100 mass ratio. After bath-sonication for 30 min, the ink was deposited on ½ inch diameter aluminum discs and dried at 100 °C. The Composite electrodes were prepared by mixing active material (85%), carbon black (2% Csp, Timcal, 5% KS6) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) (8%, Kynar) dispersed in NMP with homogenizer.

The slurry was then bladed onto aluminum sheet with a gap of 10 μ m.  Both the composite or carbon-free binder-free electrodes were punched and pressed at 6.3 T cm -2  under a hydraulic press, to favor embedding of the powder in the aluminum disc in the case of the carbon-free, binder-free electrodes. The resulted loading of the positive electrode materials is around 2-3 mg/ cm 2 . Finally, the electrodes were completely dried at 120 °C under vacuum for 24 h.  For the XPS characterization of Li2CO3, we add in 10%wt acetylene black (AB) when making the electrodes due to the non-conductive nature of Li2CO3.

The composite electrode for in situ FT-IR was composed of NMC (85 wt%, from Ecopro and Umicore) as the active material, carbon black (5 wt % KS6 and 2 wt% Super P, both from Timcal) as an electrically conductive carbon, and poly(vinylidene fluoride) (8 wt%, PVDF, Kynar) as the binder. These materials were mixed thoroughly with N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP, Aldrich) in a 1:15 mass ratio, using a planetary centrifugal mixer (THINKY AR-100). The obtained slurry was drop-casted onto glassy fiber substrates (Whatman 934-AH, 10 mm in diameter) and dried at 100  o C. Then the composite composites were compressed at 0.5 T/cm 2 using  a  hydraulic  press  to  improve  electrical  conductivity.  Finally  the  electrodes  were completely  dried  at  120 o C  under  vacuum  for  24h.  The  active  material  loading  was  ~6.5 mg/cm 2 , but it is noted here that the effective loading is smaller because some particles could permeate into the glassy fiber and not all of the loading is on the top surface.

Electrochemistry Electrochemical behavior of the electrodes was confirmed by galvanostatic  measurements  in  two-electrodes  cells  (Tomcell  type  TJ-AC).  Cells  were assembled in an argon-filled glovebox (&lt;0.5 ppm of H2O and O2) and comprised a lithium metal  foil  as  the  negative  electrode  and  the  positive  electrode,  separated  by  two  pieces  of

polypropylene separator (2500 Celgard), impregnated with 100 μ L of different electrolytes including LP57 (1M LiPF6 in a 3:7 ethylene carbonate (EC): ethylmethyl carbonate (EMC) electrolyte (BASF)). After assembly, the cells rested for 6 h prior to measurement and then were charged with different end-of-charge potentials (4.1, 4.2, 4.4, and 4.6 VLi) at a C/100 rate, based  on  the  theoretical  capacity  calculated  assuming  full  delithiation.  The  cells  were maintained at end-of-charge potential for 5 h before disassembly in the glovebox. For carbonfree binder-free electrode, the electrodes were gently rinsed with 100 μ L of EMC and dried under vacuum at room temperature for 3 h.

The composite electrodes are cycled with two formation cycles with a constant C rate of C/10 (28 mA/g) from 2 VLi, to 4.4 VLi. The charging was conducted in a constant current constant voltage (CCCV) mode with a current cutoff of C/20 (14 mA/g) at upper cutoff potential. The cycling was conducted with a constant C rate of 1C (280 mA/g) from 2 VLi,  to 4.4 VLi, with a CCCV cutoff of C/20 (14 mA/g) at 4.4 VLi cutoff.

FT-IR spectroscopy An in situ FT-IR spectro-electrochemical cell is based on the design based on our previous work. 12  A calcium fluoride (CaF2) hemisphere (Diameter 20mm, Pier optics) was used as the optical prism, with Pt as the current collector (sputtered at ∼ 0.3 Å/s for 15 nm, as measured by an electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance), and the prism was attached to a Teflon part as the wall. The cell was assembled in an argon-filled glovebox ([H2O] and [O2]&lt;0.5 ppm, MBraun). Comprised composite NMC/glassy fiber is the positive electrode, and a lithium metal foil is the negative electrode, separated by two pieces of polypropylene separator  (2325  Celgard)  with  100  μL  of  electrolytes.  The  lithium  foil  was  covered  by  a stainless  steel  plate  as  a  spacer,  and  a  spring  was  compressed  by  a  cap  on  top  to  reduce

composite electrode electronic resistance. In this setup, NMC on the glassy fiber was placed downward  and  faced  towards  the  prism,  so  that  the  IR  signals  could  collect  the  surface information on NMC particles. Electrolytes could permeate through the glassy fiber, so that the diffusion is not restricted.

After assembly, the cell was first rested for 6 hours. Next, galvanostatic charge were performed using BCS-COM (Biologic) and VMP3 (Biologic). Electrochemical behavior of the electrodes in the in situ FT-IR spectro-electrochemical cell was confirmed by galvanostatic measurements above. For the measurements without oxides, sputtered Pt was the positive electrode and linear sweep voltammetry was performed.

At the same time during charging or linear voltage sweeping, in situ FT-IR measurements were performed on a Tensor II (Bruker) FT-IR equipped with deuterated triglycine sulfate (DTGS) detector  inside  an  argon-filled  glovebox.  The  FT-IR  spectra  were  acquired  in  the  singlereflection mode using an attenuated total reflection (ATR) accessory (Pike Vee-Max II, Pike Technologies) at an incident angle of 50 degrees. The spectral resolution was 4 cm -1  and the scan velocity was 1.6 kHz. Each spectrum was measured by superimposing 32 interferograms. All spectra were presented in the form of absorbance according to log( I0/I1 ), where I0 and I1 are the spectrum of background (blank Pt surface without electrolytes) and in situ spectrum of the sample, respectively.

For ex situ measurements on pristine electrolytes, the spectra were acquired in the ATR mode using a germanium (Ge) prism (Pier optics) at an incident angle of 50 degrees. Spectral settings

were the same as in situ measurements. Although we assign the observed species based on DFT and solution ATR spectra, other species such as semicarbonates cannot be excluded, because there could be other features in the convoluted bands.

XPS  measurements All  carbon-free,  binder-free  electrodes  were  transferred  from glovebox to XPS chamber using a transfer vessel (ULVAC-PHI, INC.). For each potential, at least two electrodes were charged for reproducibility. All the XPS spectra were collected using a PHI 5000 VersaProbe II (ULVAC-PHI, INC.) using a monochromatized Al K α source and a charge neutralizer. A pass energy of 23.5 eV was used and adventitious carbon at 285 eV (C1s spectra)  was  used  for  calibration  of  all  XPS  spectra.  After  subtraction  of  a  Shirley-type background, photoemission lines were fitted using combined Gaussian-Lorentzian functions, except in the case of the Co, Ni and Mn 2p3/2 lines where asymmetric line shapes were used. The RSF (relative sensitivity factors) values for C1s, O1s, F1s, P2p, Li1s, Co2p3/2, Ni2p3/2 and Mn2p3/2 photoemission lines were given as 0.314, 0.733, 1, 0.525, 0.028, 2.3526, 2.468 and 1.792  respectively.  The  chemical  compositions,  binding  energies  and  full  width  at  half maximum of all spectra can be found in Tables S1 -S3.

DFT calculations Periodic plane wave Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations were performed to study the hydrogen adsorption and ligand vacancy formation energy on a number of oxides, fluorides, sulfites and phosphate surfaces. We used the PBE functional as implemented  in  the  Vienna  Ab  Initio  Simulation  Package  (VASP)  code,  and  Projector Augmented Wave (PAW) for the description of the core-electron interaction, and the plane wave cutoff was set to 450 eV. The surfaces were modeled with slabs of thicknesses between 10 and 12 Å, separated by at least 13 Å and a dipole correction was applied in order to eliminate

spurious interactions across the periodic boundary along the direction perpendicular to the surface. For the calculations to compare the hydrogen adsorption energy of F-doped LiNiO2 and the undoped case (Figure C1), we apply a Ueff = 6.4 eV on Ni, as GGA is known to delocalize the electrons and generally has inaccurate description for redox energetics for later transition metal oxides. 43

## 5.1 Introduction

Positive  electrode  materials  used  in  commercial  lithium-ion  batteries  are  based  on  layered Li M O2  ( M =  Co,  Ni,  Mn),  where  the  reversible  redox  of  3 d transition  metals  including Co 3+ /Co 4+ , 1,2 Ni 2+ /Ni 4+ (or Ni 3+ /Ni 4+ ) 3-5 and Mn 3+ /Mn 4+ , 6,7 can deliver capacities of up to 200 mAh/g. Thackeray et al. 8,9 have synthesized Li2MnO3-derived materials such as Li(LixMnyNizCo1-x-y-z)O2 (Li-rich Mn-rich NMC) 10-14  which have shown enhanced discharge capacities of ~300 mAh/g, coming from cationic redox as well as lattice oxygen redox, 12,13,15,16 The cycling stability of Li-rich Mn-rich NMC shows a significant voltage decay as well as a capacity  fade  over  subsequent  cycles,  which  is  related  to  diminishing  oxygen  redox  upon extended cycling. 10,17  Fundamental understanding for the origin of oxygen redox is needed  for the development of novel and non-noble oxides that employ reversible oxygen redox to boost the capacity and energy density of Li-ion batteries. 15,18-21

Li2 M O3 ( M = Ru and Ir) 22-25  has been used as a model system to understand oxygen redox in oxides. Li2RuO3 22,24,26  and Li2IrO3 25,27 show reversible capacities with a two-electron transfer process and high cycling stability. For example, Tarascon and co-workers have shown that Li2Ru1-xMnxO3 24  and Li2Ru1-xSnxO3 11,22 deliver first discharge capacities as high as 250 mAh/g, and capacity retention capabilities higher than 80%  after 100  cycles. The  capacity corresponding to the second electron transfer has been attributed to reversible lattice oxygen

oxidation into peroxo- and superoxo- like species in the bulk. 26,28  Currently, there are two schools of seemingly contradictory thoughts on the requirement for reversible anionic redox. In the first school of thought, the reversible oxygen redox is proposed to scale with the ionicity of the metal-oxygen bond. Yabuuchi et al. 29,30 have reported that increasing the ionicity of the transition metal and oxygen bond can reduce the overlap between metal and oxygen electronic density-of-states (DOS), 29  forbidding the oxidation of oxygen ion into molecular oxygen. This thinking is exemplified in the superior cycling stability of more ionic oxides Li1.2Ti0.4Mn0.4O2 and the more depressed oxygen evolution of this material upon charging to 4.8VLi, compared with  those  of  Li1.2Ti0.4Fe0.4O2. 29   Further  support  comes  from  density  functional  theory calculations  (DFT)  results  by  Doublet et  al. 20,31 ,  where  has  been  shown  that  as  the  charge transfer gap decreases, the covalency of the transition metal and oxygen increases. As a result, this lower charge transfer gap induces more oxygen character at the Fermi level, resulting in a larger degree of charge compensation coming from the oxygen, shortening of the O-O bond, and eventually leading to irreversible oxygen release. 20  A certain ionicity between metal and oxygen is needed to maintain reversible oxygen redox. 20

The second school of thought argues that more reversible anionic redox activity comes from a more  covalent  interaction  between  the  transition  metal  and  oxygen  bond  in  the  oxide. Saubanère et al. 28  have reported from crystal orbital overlap population (COOP) analysis that the greater covalent bonding between Ru and O in Li2-xRuO3 stabilizes the peroxo-like species upon oxidation more than that in Li2-xMnO3. This idea has also been further explored by Bruce and coworkers. 16  In this work, an O K-edge resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) study on Li-rich Mn-rich NMC showed an electronic structure fingerprint, which was assigned to the

formation  of  oxygen-localized  electron  holes,  where  these  researchers  concluded  that  the reversibility  of  the  anionic  redox  relies  on  more  delocalized  M-O  bonds  from  higher  M-O covalency.  In our previous work by combining X-ray absorption and emission spectra as well as  excited  states  calculations  on  charged  Li2-xRuO3, 32 we  were  able  to  pinpoint  the experimental electronic fingerprint of (O-O) σ* states coordinated with Ru d states in corelevel spectroscopies. Such type of signature is missing in charged Li2-xMnO3, 32,33 which suffers irreversible oxygen redox and molecular oxygen evolution, again highlighting the importance of metal oxygen covalency in stabilizing anionic redox. In our follow-up work 33 , we showed that  such  Ru-O  covalency  results  in  phonon  hardening  in  the  oxide  lattice  upon  lithium deintercalation, resulting in more stable oxygen sublattice towards oxygen redox intermediates, inducing more reversible oxygen redox. In this work, we hypothesize that the larger degree overlap between transition metal and oxygen electronic states introduces a more rigid oxygen sublattice upon lithium deintercalation, resulting in a more reversible oxygen redox.

In this study, for the systematic examination of the role of M-O covalency in reversible anionic redox, we employ Li2RuO3 as the host lattice to substitute in different transition metal elements to slightly tune the covalency between the transition-metal and oxygen. We characterize the redox behavior and structural changes using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Coupled with differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) measurements and electrochemistry, we are able to identify the reversible component of anionic redox in each of the  substituted  materials  and  quantify  the  reversibility  of  the  anionic  redox.  Through  DFT calculations, an electron-phonon-coupled descriptor for the reversibility of anionic redox is

then proposed, which allows for future high-throughput screening of next generation highenergy density Li-ion positive electrodes materials.

## 5.2Result and Discussion

5.2.1Coupled electronic and phononic trend in M-substituted Li2RuO3

Figure 5-1: (a) DFT computed pDOS and X-ray absorption and emission spectroscopy (XES and XAS) showing the projected electronic density of states of Li2RuO3, where due to the covalent nature of Ru-O bond, there is a large degree of energetic overlap between the Ru d states and O p states at the Fermi level (dashed line). (b) Computed pDOS of Li2RuO3 (left) and Li2Ru0.75Mn0.25O3 (right), where by introducing 3 d metal dopants, such as Mn 4+ , which are in general more electronegative compared with Ru 4+ , results  in  less  overlap  between  the  metal  and  oxygen  around  the  Fermi  level.  (c) Correlation between the center of mass difference of filled metal d -states and O p -states of fully lithiated M -substituted Li2Ru0.75 M 0.25O3 (filled circle) versus the O phonon band center of partially lithiated M -substituted Li1Ru0.75 M 0.25O3, where we observed a strong correlation between the M d -O p states and the O phonon band center. This correlation indicates that a smaller difference between M and O electronic states induces a greater overlap  at  the  Fermi  level  of  the  oxide,  inducing  a  stiffer  oxide  lattice  upon  lithium deintercalation and a larger frequency of the oxygen phonon band center.

By  substituting  different  transition  metal  elements  into  the  Li2RuO3  host  lattice,  the oxygen  phonon  band  center  of  delithiated  LiRux M 1-xO3  which  describes  the  oxygen lattice integrity upon lithium deintercalation, has a strong positive correlation with the metal-oxygen covalency, characterized by the energetic overlap between metal d states and O p electronic states. From DFT calculations of the projected density of states (pDOS)

and experimental density of states from X-ray spectroscopies in Figure 5-1(a), Ru has a large degree of overlap with the oxygen states, which is quite different from 3 d transition metals such as Mn, where in Li2MnO3 it is primarily the nonbonding oxygen, without the presence of Mn states, pinned at the Fermi level, as shown in previous work. 33  The larger degree of overlap between Ru and O electronic states is also manifested when we compare the computed pDOS of Li2RuO3 and substituted Li2Ru0.75Mn0.25O3 in Figure 51(b), where by introducing Mn substituents, the total metal d band center of the transition metal  shifts  downwards,  reducing  the  energetic  overlap  between  oxygen  and  the transition metal. Such decrease of energetic overlap between the transition metal and oxygen at the Fermi level induces a more flexible lattice upon lithium deintercalation, as shown in Figure 5-1(c). As we decrease the energetic overlap between metal and oxygen near  the  Fermi  level,  the  O  phonon  band  center  of  metal  oxides  upon  lithium deintercalation also shifts toward lower frequency, marking a less rigid M-O framework in the delithiated oxides. In our previous works, 33 Li2(Ru,Ir)O3, which exhibits reversible lattice  oxygen  redox,  in  comparison  with    Li2(Mn,Sn)O3,  which  releases  molecular oxygen upon lithium deintercalation, shows a larger degree of energetic overlap at the Fermi level, leading to more covalent M-O bonds as well as a hardened oxide lattice upon  lithium  deintercalation.  Therefore,  we  propose  that  the  lattice  oxygen  redox reversibility directly scales with the metal oxygen energetic overlap near the Fermi level as  well  as  the  oxygen  phonon  band  center  upon  lithium  deintercalation.  To  test  this hypothesis, in the next section we will discuss quantification methods of the reversibility of anionic redox and qualify our hypothesis based on substituted Li2Rux M 1-xO3 ( M = Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ru, Sn, Ir, Pt).

## 5.2.2 Greater oxygen redox reversibility in M-substituted Li2RuO3 with increasing metaloxygen covalency and oxygen lattice hardening

To evaluate the reversibility of anionic redox, DEMS measurements were conducted on the  composite  Li2Rux M 1-xO3  electrodes  to  detect  the  molecular  oxygen  evolution, whereby substituting different transition metal elements, the amount of oxygen evolution in  general  increases  with  more  electronegative  substituents  (Figure  5-2).  DEMS data reveal similar onset potentials and amounts of CO2 outgassing for charged composite Li2Rux M 1-xO3 ( M = Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ru, Sn, Ir, Pt) electrodes (Figure 5-2 and Figure D1), which are typically attributed to the decomposition of electrolyte at high potentials. 34,35 The similar amount of CO2 evolution across different chemistries is rooted in the same amount of electrolyte in the cell and close surface area of the positive electrode active materials. The voltage onset of CO2 evolution around 4.1 VLi, which is comparable to the other Ru based systems such as Li1.2Ni0.2Ru0.6O2 36 , yet not detected in Li2Ru0.75Sn0.25O2 in Sathiya et al. 22  due to potential insensitivity of their measurement and lower amount of electrolyte used in the cell. Such CO2 potential onset is slightly earlier than that for 3 d -based Li-rich systems, which is around 4.5 VLi for Li-rich NMC Li1.17[Ni0.22Co0.12Mn0.66]0.83O2 34 , Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2 37 and disordered rock-salt Li2Mn2/3Nb1/3O2F. 38   While  the  oxygen  evolution  profile  varies  drastically  across different chemistries, for Li2Rux M 1-xO3 ( M = Ru, Pt, Ir, Ti) with relatively more covalent metal-oxygen interactions, we observe a similar oxygen evolution profile, where after the onset of oxygen evolution, there is a continuous and steady-rate oxygen evolution without any obvious peak feature. (Figure D1) Materials represented by Li2Rux M 1-xO3 ( M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Sn) with slightly less covalent M-O bonds have a much more well-

defined oxygen evolution peak, with an onset at a higher state-of-charge compared to the other materials, also with a relatively larger amount of oxygen evolution. (Figure 5-2) The oxygen evolution profile we observed in Li2Ru0.75Sn0.25O2 is also very close to what was observed in Sathiya et al. 22   However, the difference in oxygen evolution profile, which  seems  to  depend  on  the  electronic  structures  of  oxides,  is  not  pointed  out  in previous  works  on  the  Li-rich  systems  and  requires  future  more  detailed  studies  to understand the physical origin.

The reversibility of the anionic redox activity defined in this work is shown to increase for more covalent metal substituted Li2Rux M 1-xO3 ( M = Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ru, Sn, Pt, Ir) and a more rigid oxygen lattice upon lithium deintercalation. To quantify the reversibility of the anionic redox process experimentally, we here first define the anionic reversibility

Figure  of  merit  as 1 #HIJKL	3KMKNOK #HIJKL	3KP#H	KMK$Q3#L	Q3NLORK3 ,  where  oxygen  release  could  be measured as the integrated total oxygen release during the first charge cycle, as measured by DEMS  (detailed  methods  and quantification methods  are discussed in the Methodology section), and the electron transfer can be obtained by integrating the dQ/dV curve for the second plateau, which has been shown in earlier works 11,32 associated with oxygen redox, upon first charge (shown in Methods in details). The larger this Figure of merit is, suggesting a smaller oxygen release with respect to the total electron transfer associated  with  oxygen,  therefore  the  more  reversible  is  the  anionic  redox.  Such  a definition  can  more  effectively  to  decouple  the  oxygen  redox  from  the  metal  redox, where one could alternatively define a such Figure of merit by using #HIJKL	3KP#H	KMK$Q3#L	Q3NLORK3	=S#L	P+O$TN3JK , yet such definition introduces the complexity

#HIJKL	3KP#H	KMK$Q3#L	Q3NLORK3	=S#L	$TN3JK

that substituent metals and Ru might also be reduced in addition to oxygen redox upon discharge 11,15,17,22 , where the discharge profile typically has one convoluted plateau. 11 As a  result,  this  definition  would  introduce  more  complexity  in  separating  the  metal reduction and oxygen reduction process upon discharge. 11  In the definition employed in our work, we only use the information from the first charge, and the high-voltage plateau has been shown clearly to be related to the oxygen-redox plateau in previous work 11,32 , which is quite easy to separate from the cationic redox that is represented by the lowervoltage plateau. 11,22,27,32  Here we examine this defined Figure of merit as a function of the computed energetic difference between filled M d and O p states and O phononic band center in Figure 5-3 (a) and (b). As we increase the distance between metal d states and oxygen p states, we are decreasing the covalency and bond strength between metal and oxygen around the Fermi level, resulting in less reversible oxygen redox activity.

(Figure 5-3(a)) This decrease of bond covalency between M and O is also evident in the simultaneous drop in the stiffness of the M-O framework upon lithium extraction (Figure 5-1(c)), inducing a lower oxygen phonon band center for the delithiated oxides. This coupling  between  electronic  structure  and  lattice  dynamics  has  shown  that  the reversibility of anionic redox also trends nicely with the oxygen phonon band center, where a softer oxygen lattice upon lithium removal induces generally more irreversible oxygen redox behavior. It is worth noting that lithium deintercalation from Li1 M O3 to Li0.5 M O3 results in a softening of the oxygen lattice for most of the substituted systems. We believe that such an observation is due to the incapability of transition metals to be further being oxidized from 5+ to 6+ in an octahedral environment 32,39 , therefore the oxide lattice become less rigid upon lithium deintercalation 33 , which is the case for M = Ti, Mn, Ru, Sn. However, for the case of the Cr-substituted system, Cr can be oxidized all the way up to 6+ in solid state 40 , further increasing the covalency between M-O and the oxide lattice stiffness, pushing up the oxygen phonon band center. Moreover, the oxygen phonon band center for Li0.5CrO3 is also shifted upwards by the high frequency of  the  short  O-O  vibration  upon  lithium  deintercalation  as  shown  in  Figure  D3(c). Furthermore, the observed trend is not dependent on the method we use to calculate the electron  transfer  correlated  with  the  oxygen  redox.  If  we  calculate  the  oxygen  redox electron transfer by alternatively integrating the total electrons transferred after the onset of oxygen gas evolution, the reversibility still trends with the electronic structure and phononic descriptors as shown in Figure D5.

The  open  circle represents the calculated O phonon band center of Li0.5Ru0.75 M 0.25O3 and the closed circle represents the calculated O phonon band center of Li1Ru0.75 M 0.25O3.

The oxygen  phonon  band  center  is  obtained  from  our  previous  work 33   and  additional calculations shown in Figure D3 and Figure D4,  where for the substituted compounds, the phonon band center is taken as the weighted some of the two endpoint compounds to  simplify  the  calculations,  as  shown  in  previous  work. 41   The  methodology  of calculating the Figure of merit is shown in the methods section. The trend still stands as we switch to another method of integrating the charge based on the DEMS information, shown  in  Figure  D5.  Oxygen  redox  reversibility  follows  a  linear  trend  with  M-O covalency, described by the electronic structure, as well as the rigidity of the delithiated oxides  lattice,  as  described  by  the  phonon  structure.  A  more  covalent  metal  oxides induces a more rigid lattice upon lithium intercalation, resulting in a more reversible oxygen redox.

- 5.2.3 Ru/metal and oxygen redox from XAS of Li2-xRu0.75M0.25O3 (M= Mn, Ti, Fe) To  further  understand  the  underlying  mechanism  for  the  observed  trend,  XAS  was conducted on Ru and other transition metal substituents to reveal the redox process and structural  evolution  upon  lithium  deintercalation.  XAS  Ru  L3-edge  data  for  Li2-

xRu0.75 M 0.25O3 ( M = Mn, Ti and Fe) revealed comparable oxidation of Ru to that of Li2xRuO3 with lithium de-intercalation, as shown in Figure 5-4 (a), (b) and (c), respectively. The spectra of oxide-only Li2-xRu0.75 M 0.25O3 ( M = Mn, Ti, and Fe) pellets are comprised of two major features 42 , one at lower photon energy, corresponding to the MO interaction with electrons with t2g parentage, and the other at a higher photon energy, corresponding to  the  MO  interaction  with  electrons  with  eg  parentage,  which  are  similar  to  those reported previously for Li2-xRuO3. 32 The  onset  energy  of Ru  L3-edge  for  Li2xRu0.75 M 0.25O3 was found to shift towards a higher photon energy (upon removing ~0.8 Li for Mn and Fe substitution and ~ 0.5 Li for Ti substitution), indicating Ru oxidation during the first plateau, and then a shift towards a lower photon energy with further lithium de-intercalation, as shown in Figure 5-4(c). This trend found for the onset energy of  Ru  L3-edge  of  charged  Li2-xRu0.75M0.25O3  is  similar  to  that  of  Li2-xRuO3  reported previously 32 , which has been attributed to Ru oxidation followed by reductive coupling triggered by lattice oxygen redox. 22,27,32  This consistent Ru redox trend across different layered chemistries studied in this work highlights the limitation of the Ru redox, where Ru 4+ is only able to be oxidized to Ru 5+  upon removing 1 e - /Ru, followed by Ru reduction upon  further  oxidation  associated  with  oxygen  redox.  Moreover,  as  observed  in  our previous work, 32 such observed Ru redox process of first oxidation, then reduction is not dependent on the quantification methods that we employ to represent the Ru oxidation state. Further support of this observed redox process comes from the analysis of the t2g/eg peak  ratio  (Figure  5-4  (e))  and  t2g-eg  splitting  (Figure  D7)  as  well  as  the  white-line centroid (Figure D8). From those analyses, Ru was first oxidized, accompanied by a larger t2g/eg peak ratio and t2g-eg splitting, with the pre-peak centroid shifting towards a

higher  photon  energy;  Ru  was  then  reduced  after  removing  ~0.8  Li,  coupled  with  a smaller t2g/eg peak ratio and t2g-eg splitting (Figure D7), and the centroid shifting back to a  lower  photon  energy  (Figure  D8).  As  we  pointed  out  in  a  previous  study 32 ,  such reductive coupling observed in Ru is not necessarily the sole result of molecular oxygen evolution (Figure 5-4(d)), as the amount of oxygen release cannot explain such a large degree of metal reduction. Moreover, the oxygen release onset observed in the DEMS measurements is at a higher state-of-charge than was observed for the inflection point of the Ru L-edge energy of the charged oxides. Furthermore, different metal substituted systems exhibit drastically different amount of oxygen release, where Li2-xRu0.75Fe0.25O3 evolves ~0.16 mol O2/ f.u., in contrast with Li2-xRuO3, which evolves 0.02 mol O2/ f.u. , yet the degree of Ru backshift observed in those systems upon lithium deintercalation is quite  close,  at  around  0.15  eV.  Therefore,  the  Ru  reduction/backshift  upon  lithium removal in the second plateau is not necessarily the result of molecular oxygen evolution, but more of lattice oxygen redox. It is interesting to note, as we pointed out in previously, 32 that lattice oxygen redox results in a broadening of the eg peak towards a high photon energy. By quantifying the FWHM of the eg peak through peak fitting (Figure D12), we observe that there is a sharp increase in the eg peak width upon removing 1 e - /Ru after entering the high-voltage plateau, further verifying the assumption that the high-voltage plateau represents the lattice oxygen redox pointed out in previous publications. 11,32

Hard X-ray XAS on the transition metal K-edge shows minimal involvement of the substituted metals in Li2Ru0.75 M 0.25O3 ( M = Mn, Ti, Fe). XAS of the Ti and Mn in the substituted  systems  shows  similar  slight  reduction  upon  charging  in  Li2Ru0.75 M 0.25O3

( M = Mn, Ti), whereas Fe K-edge data show a slight oxidation of Fe 3+   upon Li removal in  Li2Ru0.75Fe0.25O3.  (Figure  D13)  As  we  remove  Li  from  the  oxide-only  pellets  of Li2Ru0.75 M 0.25O3 ( M = Mn, Ti), we observe a slight shift towards lower photon energy, which is captured in the quantification of the oxidation state using the edge onset in Figure D6 (c), indicating a slight reduction of Mn or Ti upon charging. As a result, due to  the  incapability  of  both  Mn 4+ and  Ti 4+ being  further  oxidized  in  octahedral environment, we observed minimal changes in the oxidation state of Mn and Ti upon removing most of the Li in the lattice (Figure D13 (b) and (d)).  On the other hand, in the Fe system, due to the instability of Fe 4+ in the solid-state, the pristine Li2Ru0.75Fe0.25O3  shows  an  oxidation  state  of  Fe 3+ .  Upon  lithium  deintercalation  by removing around 1.75 Li/ f.u. in Li2Ru0.75Fe0.25O3, there is a clear oxidation, yet such oxidation of Fe is quite subtle, reaching an edge of 7124.3 eV at half-rise, compared with an edge of around 7128-7129 eV, which is roughly the theoretical Fe 4+  edge onset by linear extrapolation of the edge energy of Fe 2+  and Fe 3+ .  As a result, even though the charged Li2Ru0.75Fe0.25O3 shows a slightly different trend in Fe oxidation compared with Mn and Ti in charged Li2Ru0.75Mn0.25O3 and Li2Ru0.75Ti0.25O3, the degree of involvement of  those  transition  metals  in  redox  is  negligible  compared  to  Ru  in  those  substituted systems, as shown in Figure 5-4.

The  t2g  and  eg  areas  are  determined  by  fitting  two  Gaussian  peaks  with  a  linear background  removed.  Quantification  of  the  Ru  oxidations  state  using  an  alternative method with t2g and eg centroids are shown in Figure D7 and Figure D8, where we have shown  similar  oxidation  and  reduction  trends  to  that  shown  in  (d).    Details  of  the Gaussian  fitting  are  shown  in  Figures  D9,  D10,  and  D11.  The  quantification  of previously reported Li2RuO3 32  is also shown for comparison for the substituted systems in (d) and (e), where the edge onset is manually shifted by 0.7 eV for better comparison because Li2RuO3 and Li2Ru0.75 M 0.25O3( M = Ti, Mn, Fe) were measured at two different beamtimes, and there is a slight shift in the beam energy.

## 5.2.4 Disorder in the first-shell M-O coordination from Metal K-edge EXAFS of Li2xRu0.75M0.25O3

Transition metal K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) reveals a significant reduction in intensity in the first-shell coordination of Ti-O and Fe-O in Li2xRu0.75 M 0.25O3 ( M = Ti and Fe) with lithium de-intercalation in Figure 5-5(b) and (d), respectively, in contrast to that of Ru-O in Li2-xRuO3 and Mn-O in Li2-xRu0.75Mn0.25O3 in Figure 5-5(a) and (c), respectively. Fourier-transformed spectra in the R-space (Figure 5-5 (a), (b), (c), (d)) show two major contributions, one located at a reduced distance of around 1.5 Å, representing M-O coordination, and the other located at a reduced distance of around 2.5 Å, representing M-M coordination. Similarly, Fourier-transformed Ti Kedge EXAFS of Li2-xRu0.75Ti0.25O3 (Figure 5-5(b)) and Fourier-transformed Fe K-edge EXAFS of Li2-xRu0.75Fe0.25O3 (Figure 5-5(d)) reveals significant decreases in the Ti-O and Fe-O coordination upon charging, respectively. On the other hand, substituting Ru with Mn in Li2-xRuO3, led to an insignificant reduction in the Mn-O coordination in the first shell from Mn K-edge EXAFS, as shown in Figure 5-5(c), having slight reduction of  Mn-O  coordination  by  ~20%  in  intensity  upon  lithium  removal  in  charged  Li2xRu0.75Mn0.25O3. The insignificant reduction in the Mn-O coordination in the first shell of  Li2-xRu0.75Mn0.25O3  is  accompanied  with  minimal  changes  observed  in  the  Ru-O

coordination in the Fourier-transformed Ru K-edge EXAFS of Li2-xRu0.75Mn0.25O3 in Figure D19(a), compared with that in Li2-xRuO3 (Figure 5-5(a)).

The decrease in the M-O intensity 43-45  and metal-oxygen coordination in the first shell (MO6) for Ti-O (Figure 5-4(b))  can be attributed to the considerable disordering in the first-shell introduced by lithium deintercalation, compared with Mn-O (Figure 5-4(c)). The creation of considerable oxygen vacancies cannot be used to explain the observed large reduction in Ti-O in comparison with Mn-O coordination in the EXAFS spectra. Li2-xRu0.75Ti0.25O3  (with  an  oxygen  release  of  0.08  mol  O2/moloxide)  has  an  oxygen evolution that is very comparable to Li2-xRu0.75Mn0.25O3 (with oxygen release of 0.12 mol O2/moloxide) based on DEMS measurements shown in Figures 5-2. If we assume that the oxygen vacancies created were distributed uniformly throughout the bulk of particles instead of being concentrated near the surface region, the similarity in the amount of oxygen  evolved  cannot  explain  the  drastic  difference  in  M-O  contribution  evolution upon charge. Moreover, the transition metal vacancy induced by metal dissolution as a parasitic  reaction  upon  charging  can  also  not  be  the  likely  reason  for  the  difference observed in the metal K-edge EXAFS, because previous studies have shown that it is more  difficult  to  dissolve  Ti 4+   in  comparison  with  Mn 4+ by  substituting  Ti  into 0.5Li2MnO3-0.5LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2 46 .  Therefore,  the  increased  reduction  in  the  first-shell Ti-O coordination can be attributed to a greater pseudo Debye-Waller factor of M-O coordination extracted from the EXAFS spectra for Li2-xRu0.75Ti0.25O3 than Li2RuO3 and Li2-xRu0.75Mn0.25O3 (Figure 5-5(a), (c)), coming from a distorted M-O octahedron upon lithium deintercalation. On the other hand, for charged Li2-xRu0.75Fe0.25O3, which evolves

more significant amount of oxygen (~0.16 mol/ f.u. ) compared to other systems studied by EXAFS, the more significant reduction in the Fe-O contribution in the Fe EXAFS spectra compared with Mn, Ru based systems might be the compounded result of oxygen vacancy creations and octahedral distortion. To verify the hypothesis on the differences in tendency toward octahedral distortion across different substituted Li2-xRu0.75 M 0.25O3 upon lithium deintercalation, the systematic tuning of oxygen framework distortion is studied using DFT in the next section.

Here, Li2Ru0.75Ti0.25O3 and Li2Ru0.75Fe0.25O3 shows significant reduction in the M-O peak intensity compared to Li2Ru0.75Mn0.25O3 at a high state-of-charge, which is responsible for the difference in the increase of the pseudo Debye-Waller factor.

## 5.2.5 Tuning of the O-O distance shows evidence of two competing mechanisms of irreversible oxygen redox

Computational tuning of the oxygen-oxygen distance in Li0Ru0.75 M 0.25O3  ( M = Ti, Mn, Ru) shows that by introducing less covalent substitutions from Ru to Ti or Mn, the barrier of forming oxygen dimers within the MO octahedron is reduced. Moreover, the observed more depressed M-O contribution in the Ti-substituted system at high states-of-charge from EXAFS comes from an easier MO octahedral distortion for Ti compared with Ru and Mn. Here, we employed the fully delithiated structures as the starting structures, where we selected an oxygen-oxygen pair, either within the oxygen octahedron, or across two layers (shown schematically in Figure 5-6 (a) and (b) insets), where we forced that pair to have a fixed shorter distance, while allowing the other atoms in the unit cell to relax.  Therefore, we are able to probe the barrier of O-O bond formation either within the MO octahedron or across the layer in the substituted systems. As we tune the oxygenoxygen distance within the octahedron in Li2Ru0.75 M 0.25O3 ( M = Mn, Ti, Ru), the Mnsubstituted case shows a relatively big barrier of around 0.6 eV towards a reduction in bond distance to 1.3 Å. Such a dimerization barrier with Li2Ru0.75Mn0.25O3 lies roughly between the two end-point compounds Li2RuO3 (red circle) and Li2MnO3 (grey circle) in Figure 5-6(a). Compared with Li2Ru0.75Mn0.25O3, Li2Ru0.75Ti0.25O3 basically shows the

absence of such a barrier for octahedral distortion, which is the root cause of the increase in the Ti-O first shell disorder upon lithium deintercalation in charged Li2Ru0.75Ti0.25O3 as observed in EXAFS (Figure 5-5 (b) and (e)). On the other hand, imposing such a shorter oxygen-oxygen distance across the layer (across different octahedrons) (Figure 5-6 (b)) induce less obvious metal substituent dependency, where Ti shows a slightly higher barrier towards forming shorter oxygen bonds across the layer. Therefore, we can generalize that materials with a slightly smaller degree of metal and oxygen DOS overlap near the Fermi level, have a higher tendency to form an O-O dimer within the octahedron due to less-directional M-O bonding. 47,48  As summarized in Figure 5-6(c), the barrier to form  O-O  within  the  M-O  octahedron  is  highly  dependent  on  the  energetic  overlap between metal and oxygen DOS center of mass distance, whereas the barrier of forming O-O bond across different layers is weakly dependent on the transition metal substituents introduced in the system. Therefore, as we decrease the energetic overlap between the transition metal and oxygen, there is a transition from forming an O-O dimer across the layer towards forming the O-O bonds within the octahedron. As a result, as we decrease the M-O energetic overlap, we are decreasing the overall energetic barrier to form shorter O-O bonds, inducing a higher tendency in forming molecular oxygen and less reversible anionic  redox.  This  observation  explains  the  linear  dependence  of  the  oxygen  redox reversibility  on  both  the  electronic  DOS  overlap  as  well  as  the  oxygen  phonon  band center, observed in Figure 5-3(a) and (b), respectively.

## 5.2.6 Insights into design guidelines for novel high-energy positive electrode materials

The observations in this work again highlight the importance of maintaining the large degree of energetic overlap between the metal and oxygen DOS near the Fermi level for introducing a rigid lattice upon lithium deintercalation and a higher barrier of irreversible oxygen dimers. This requirement poses two clear strategies in designing new Li-rich high-energy electrode materials. The first strategy relies on using less correlated and more delocalized transition metal ions (4 d and 5 d transition metals) which have some degree of redox capability upon lithium deintercalation. Such transition metals include previously  explored  Ru 4+  22-24,36 ,  Ir 4+  25,27 ,  and  Mo 4+ / 3+49 ,  which  shows  promising performance,  as  well  as  those  not  yet  explored  such  as  Rh 4+ .  From  what  we  have observed in this study, early 4 d and 5 d transition metal would not be good candidates as due to the absence of d electrons, since there are no accessible metal states around the Fermi level, leading to the decoordination of oxygen redox intermediates. However, a single transition metal redox center poses a large limitation on redox center choice and cost  challenges  related  to  those  feasible  noble  transition  metals.  Therefore,  another strategy  for  the  design  of  reversible  anionic  redox  positive  electrodes  involves substituting 3 d Li-rich positive electrodes with less correlated transition metals such as Ru 4+ , Ir 4+ , Mo 4+ / 3+ , and W 3+  to introduce a larger degree of energetic overlap between M and O to increase the barrier to oxygen dimerization. The integration of Mo 3+  and Ru 4+ into  the  Li-rich  Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2  has  been  previously  explored  experimentally  and computationally 50 , and was shown to have much more improved reversibility compared to  pristine  Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2.  To  systematically  explore  the  substitution  options  that improve the oxygen redox reversibility beyond chemical intuition, a high-throughput computational and/or experimental approach are needed for identifying oxide

compositions with a large degree of energetic overlap between the transition metal and oxygen in future studies.

Figure 5-6: Computed energetic evolution as a function of the oxygen-oxygen distance (a) within the octahedron and (b) across the layer in Li0Ru0.75 M 0.25O3 ( M = Mn, Ti, Ru) and Li0MnO3 from the literature 33 , where the insets show the schematics of the structures. The Li0MnO3 data from previous work are normalized by a factor of four due to the inclusion of four dimers created in the super cell compared with only one dimer created in this work. (c) The barrier of Li2Ru0.75 M 0.25O3 ( M = Mn, Ti, Ru). Here we can see that, compared with the Ti-substituted case, Mn has a higher barrier to forming the oxygen dimer within the octahedron due to the rigidity of the metal-oxygen lattice, where the barrier of dimerization across the layer does not show a strong dependence of the energetic overlap between the M d states and O p states.

## 5.3 Conclusions

In our work, we examined an electronic and phononic descriptor for the anionic redox activity of  the  Li2Ru0.75 M 0.25O3 ( M =  Ti,  Cr,  Mn,  Fe,  Ru,  Sn,  Pt,  Ir)  system.  Through  DEMS measurements, coupled with electrochemistry profile, we proposed a methodology to quantify the reversibility of anionic redox based on the ratio of oxygen release with respect to oxygen electron transfer. We demonstrated that for the substituted systems, the electronic structure is coupled with the rigidity of the oxide sublattice upon lithium deintercalation, where a larger degree of energetic overlap between the transition metal and oxygen induces a more rigid oxygen  lattice  upon  lithium  deintercalation  from  phonon  calculations.  As  a  result,  the

reversibility of anionic redox scales with the degree of overlap between the M d and O 2 p states of the oxides. Employing EXAFS measurements and DFT calculations, we observed that such a trend is rooted in that more ionic substituents with smaller energetic overlap between the M d and O 2 p states introduce easier distortion of M-O octahedron, thus giving a smaller barrier to  forming  an  oxygen  dimer  within  the  octahedron,  thus  inducing  oxygen  release  and irreversible  oxygen  redox.  Moreover,  the  barrier  to  forming  oxygen  dimer  across  different layers show minimal metal dependence. As a result, as we increase the separation between metal and oxygen DOS below the Fermi level, there is a transition from the preference towards forming O-O bonds across the layer to forming O-O bonds within the octahedron. More ionic substituent  introduces  a  decrease  in  the  oxygen  dimerization  barrier  and  a  less  reversible oxygen redox. Therefore, an optimized M d - O p DOS distance is needed for the harvesting of reversible anionic activity. Through this study, we were able to propose some new design strategies that can potentially induce more reversible anionic redox, providing guidance for future rational high-energy electrode exploration.

## 5.4 Methods Experimental methods

Solid-state  synthesis The  pristine  Li2RuO3,  Li2Ru0.75Cr0.25O3 and  Li2Ru0.75Ir0.25O3  were synthesized through the solid-state route previously undertaken by Goodenough et al. 51   and Tarascon et al.  22   Li2CO3 (Sigma-Aldrich, ACS reagent ≥ 99.0%) and RuO2 (Sigma-Aldrich and Alfa Aesar, anhydrous 99.9% trace metal basis) precursors are first dried under air flow at 300  o C  for  4  h.  The  precursors  (Li2CO3,  RuO2,  CrO2  (Sigma-Aldrich,  Magtrieve TM ),  IrO2 (Sigma-Aldrich,  anhydrous  99.9%  trace  metal  basis))  were  then  mixed  in  stoichiometric amounts, but with a Li excess of 10 %, with a mortar and a pestle for 1 h in an argon-filled

glovebox (H2O, O2 &lt; 0.5 ppm). The resultant powder was pelletized under 1 MPa and calcined and sintered at 1000  o C and 900 o C under air with heating rate of 2 o C/min for 24 h and 48 h, respectively, with intermediate grinding. The pristine Li2Ru0.75Mn0.25O3, Li2Ru0.5Mn0.5O3 and Li2Ru0.75Sn0.25O3  are  synthesized  with  precursors  (Li2CO3,  RuO2,  MnCO3  (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9% trace metal basis)), SnC2O4 (Sigma-Aldrich, 98%)) mixed in stoichiometric amounts, but with a Li excess of 10 %, with a mortar and a pestle for 1 h in an argon-filled glovebox (H2O, O2 &lt; 0.5 ppm). The resultant powder was pelletized under 1 MPa and calcined and sintered at 800, 900 and 1100  o C under air with heating rate of 2 o C/min for 6, 6 and 12 h, respectively, with intermediate grinding. The pristine Li2Ru0.75Pt0.25O3 was synthesized with precursors (Li2CO3, RuO2, Pt (Tanaka Precious Metal)) mixed in stoichiometric amounts, but with a Li excess of 10 %, with a mortar and a pestle for 1 h in an argon-filled glovebox (H2O, O2 &lt; 0.5 ppm). The resultant powder was pelletized under 1 MPa and calcined and sintered at 750  o C and 1050  o C under air with heating rate of 2 o C/min for 12 h and 12 h, respectively, with  intermediate  grinding.  The  pristine  Li2Ru0.75Fe0.25O3  was  synthesized  with  precursors mixed (Li2CO3, RuO2, Fe2O3(Acros Organics, 99.999% trace metal basis)) in stoichiometric amounts, but with a Li excess of 10 %, with a mortar and a pestle for 1 h in an argon-filled glovebox (H2O, O2 &lt; 0.5 ppm). The resultant powder was pelletized under 1 MPa and calcined and sintered at 1000  o C and 900  o C under air with heating rate of 2 o C/min for 24 h and 24 h, respectively, with intermediate grinding. All the resultant powder is stored inside the glovebox and  the  phase  purity  of  Li2Rux M 1-xO3 is  confirmed  through  X-ray  diffraction  (XRD)  with PANalyt'cal X'Pert PRO (Figure D20).

Positive electrode preparation The pellet electrode was prepared by pelletizing around 48 mg of active material using 6 mm diameter pressing die set (Across International) for 15 mins. The pellets  were  then  sintered  under  air  at  800  °C  (Li2Ru0.75Mn0.25O3, Li2Ru0.75Ti0.25O3  and Li2Ru0.5Mn0.5O3) and 900 °C for all the other chemistries for 6 hours. The cooling and heating rates were 2 °C/min. The pellet electrodes were then broken into pieces of around 3 mg each and dried in vacuum under 120 °C overnight before being transferred into an Argon-filled glovebox  (&lt;0.5  ppm  of  H2O  and  O2).  The  pellet  electrodes  were  used  for  the  X-ray measurements to remove any ambiguities introduced by conductive carbon and binder.

Composite electrodes for DEMS measurements were prepared by mixing the active material (80 % mass fraction), 10 % acetylene black (AB) and 10 % polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) (Solvay 6020) dispersed in N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) using a FRITSCH Minimill 23 homogenizer. The resultant slurry was then blade-coated onto a stainless steel 304 mesh with an opening of 0.0012' with a wire diameter of 0.008' with an aluminum sheet underneath, and with a gap of 15 𝜇 m. The electrodes were then dried and separated from the aluminum sheet underneath and punched into 15 mm diameter discs. The DEMS electrodes were pressed at 4.53 T cm -2  under a hydraulic press. Finally, the electrodes were dried completely at 120 °C under vacuum for 12 h before being transferred into an Argon-filled glovebox (&lt;0.5 ppm of H2O and O2). The active loading of the composite electrodes for the DEMS experiments was around 10 mg/cm 2 , which is higher than the usual loading of common composite electrodes to ensure that enough gaseous species were evolved to be detected during cycling.

Electrochemical  measurements Electrochemical  behavior  of  the  pellet  electrodes  was confirmed by galvanostatic measurements in two-electrode cells (Tomcell type TJ-AC). Cells were assembled in an argon-filled glovebox (&lt;0.5 ppm of H2O and O2) and comprised a lithium metal  foil  as  the  negative  electrode  and  the  positive  electrode,  separated  by  two  pieces  of polypropylene separator (2500 Celgard), impregnated with 150 μL of LP57 (1M LiPF6 in a 3:7 ethylene carbonate (EC): ethylmethyl carbonate (EMC) electrolyte (BASF)). After assembly, the cells rested for 6 h prior to measurement and then were charged with different end-ofcharge potentials at a rate of ≈1.6 - 1.9 mA/g, depending on the specific chemistry. This rate of charge corresponds to a rate of C/100 based on the theoretical capacity calculated assuming one lithium extraction per Li2Rux M 1-xO3. The cell was held at the end-of-charge potential for 5 h before disassembly inside the glovebox.

Differential  electrochemistry  mass  spectrometry  measurements The  DEMS  setup  was constructed in-house based on the design reported by McCloskey et  al. 52 and  used  for  the detection of gas evolution including CO2 and O2 in the head space of the electrochemistry cell along with pressure monitoring. Details on the DEMS setup and cell design are documented in Harding et  al. 53   The cell volume is around 6 cm 3  for the measurement and Argon (Airgas, 99.999 % pure, O2, H2O, CO2 &lt; 1 ppm ) was used as the carrier gas. The DEMS cells were prepared inside an argon-filled glovebox (&lt;0.5 ppm of H2O and O2) and comprised a lithium metal foil as the negative electrode and the DEMS positive electrodes, separated by two pieces of polypropylene separator (2500 Celgard), impregnated with 150 μL of LP57. The cell was first pressurized with argon to around 22 psi and allowed to rest for 8 h prior to electrochemical measurements  to  check  for  any  potential  leakage.  DEMS  measurement  started  4  h  after

pressurization with a time interval of 10 min of collecting the gas from the headspace to obtain a CO2 evolution background from th eevaporated EMC fragments. The gas evolution profile upon charge/discharge as a function of time presented in this work were already background subtracted by fitting the gas evolution profile collected in the open circuit voltage stage after pressurizing with a polynomial function. The electrochemical measurements were carried out at  a  current  density  of  14  -  19  mA/g,  depending  on  the  specific  chemistry for  charge  and discharge (corresponding to a C/10 rate by assuming 1 C = extracting 1 Li + / f.u. ), and a time interval of 10 min was set between each DEMS sequence. Please note that due to update of previous DEMS system, the measured total volume of gas evolution is around 1.5 times the measured values from our previous work. 32

Quantification of the reversibility of anionic redox In our definition of the Figure of merit, the  quantification  of  electrons  transferred  from  oxygen  redox  is  obtained  through  the electrochemistry profile upon first charge obtained from the DEMS measurement. As shown schematically in Figure D6(a) that dQ/dV is obtained from the electrochemistry profile. All the charges are integrated after around 3.9 VLi. The exception applies to Li2Ru0.75Cr0.25O3 and Li2Ru0.75Fe0.25O3, where the peaks at c.a. 4.1  VLi  and  4.0  VLi are  not  integrated  due  to  the presence of Cr 3+ and Fe 3+ , respectively, where Cr 3+/4+,5+ and Fe 3+/4+  redox potential is around 4.0-4.1 VLi. 54,55

Alternatively, we have also shown that the quantification of electrons transferred from oxygen redox can also be defined strictly as all the charges after the O2 gas onset upon first charge,

which is also shown schematically in Figure D6(b), and such a type of quantification method does not alter the trend in Figure 5-3 as we observed in Figure D5.

Synchrotron measurements After rinsing and drying, the dried pellet electrodes were mixed with sucrose or BN powder to make 10 mm pellets. The pellets were wrapped around with Kapton tape for protection during transportation for hard X-ray absorption measurements. High-energy resolution fluorescence detected Ru L3-edge XAS was conducted at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL) at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory Station 6-2b.  The  measurements  were  performed  with  a  high-resolution  tender  x-ray  spectrometer developed on a dispersive Johansson geometry in a 500 mm Rowland circle using a Si(111) analyzer. 56   The spectrometer recorded in dispersive mode the overall Ru Lα emission line; for extracting the HERFD spectrum, the peak intensity of the Lα emission line is plotted as a function  of  the  incident  photon  energy.  By  using  the  Si(111)  monochromator  of  SSRL beamline 6-2, an overall energy resolution of 0.6 eV was achieved enabling the sharpening of the Ru-L3 XAS features when compared to conventional x-ray absorption spectroscopy, i.e. , total fluorescence yield or transmission mode XAS. The incident beam was about 400 μm x 800 μm (FWHM) and the photon flux ≈ 10 12  sec -1 . The dried electrode material was mixed with  sucrose  to  minimize  any  self-absorption  effects  across  the  very  intense  Ru  L3-edge resonances, resulting in pressed pellets with an active material mass fraction concentration of 0.5 %.

Transition  metal  Ti,  Fe,  Mn  K-edge  EXAFS  was  conducted  at  beamline  6-2b  of  SSRL  in fluorescence mode with an active materials mass fraction of around 1.5 %, diluted with sucrose,

using a Si(111) analyzer. The spectra is aligned using the Si(111) glitches. Ru K-edge EXAFS was conducted at beamline 20-BM-B of Advanced Photon Source (APS) in Argonne National Laboratory in transmission mode with an active materials concentration of 10 wt%, where a Ru metal foil was used as reference. All spectroscopy data were normalized and processed using the ATHENA software package.  57  The EXAFS fitting was conducted using a k-space window of 3 Å -1  to 11 Å -1 , and R-space window of 1 to 3 Å to include both the first and second coordination shell of the metal center for Mn and Fe-substituted cases. The EXAFS fitting was conducted using a k-space window of 3 Å -1  to 10 Å -1 , and R-space window of 1.1 to 3.1 Å to include both the first and second coordination shell of the metal center for Ti-substituted cases to avoid the impact of spurious interaction observed around 0.9 Å in the EXAFS spectra in R space.  To  have  a  more  consistent  estimation  of  the  pseudo  Debye-Waller  factor,  the coordination number S0 2  is fixed to be same as the pristine oxide for the fitting of charged oxides. The details of the fitting are shown in Table D1- D4.

## Computational Methods

DFT calculations We used the Perdew-Burke-Enzerhof (PBE) 58  formulation of generalized gradient approximations (GGA) and projected augmented wave (PAW) potentials implemented in Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP) 59-61 , with Dudarev's rotationally invariant Hubbard-type U 62  applied on the transition metal where the following U values of 5 eV, 3.5 eV, 3.9 eV, 4 eV, 4 eV, 4 eV on Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ru and Ir based on literatures. 28,48  A cutoff energy of 520 eV and k-point per reciprocal atom of at least 4000 were used. The following pseudopotentials are used: Li\_sv, Ti\_sv, Cr\_pv, Mn\_pv, Fe, Ru\_pv, Ir, Sn\_d, O . The delithiated structures were generated with a primitive cell with 4 formula unit of

Li2RuO3,  where  for  each different lithium content, the most  energetically favorable configuration was taken.

The computed M d - O 2 p difference was based on the difference of center of mass of metal d states from -10 to 0 eV versus Fermi level and that of oxygen p states from -10 to 0 eV versus Fermi level. Most of the computed phonon density-of-states is taken from the previous work by  calculating  the  center  of  mass  of  oxygen  projected  non-imaginary  phonon  density  of states. 33  For the substituted compounds, the phonon density-of-states is taken as the weighted some  of  the  two  end  compounds,  as  employed  in  previous  work. 41 We  did  not  include Li2Ru0.75Fe0.25O3 because the phonon density of states of Li1Fe 5+ O3 and Li0.5Fe 5.5+ O3 results in significant portion of imaginary frequency and most of the modes are not well converged. The observed  imaginary  frequency  comes  from  the  instability  of  Fe 5+   and  above  at  room temperature and 0 K, which can only be synthesized through high pressure and temperature synthesis. 63  Therefore, we did not include the phonon datapoint from LixRu0.75Fe0.25O3 (x=1 and  0.5)  due  to  the  unstable  nature  of  Fe 5+ and  phononic  imaginary  modes  in  the  layered structure.

Computational  tuning  of  the  oxygen-oxygen  dimer  was  conducted  on  the  fully  delithiated structures  where  the  oxygen-oxygen  distance  of  a  specific  oxygen-oxygen  pair  was  either within the octahedron or across the layer.  This specific oxygen pair was not allowed to relax during computation while the other atoms as well as the cell volume and cell shape are allowed to relax to full degree of freedom.

## 6.1 Introduction

Earth-abundant  transition  metal  oxides  are  used  extensively  for  storing  charge  in  energy storage devices including Li-ion 1  or Na-ion batteries 2, 3 and electrochemical capacitors 4, 5 as well as for catalyzing key reactions involved in the chemical transformation of sustainable chemicals and fuels such as oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) 6, 7  and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) 6, 8, 9 in fuel cells 10 , electrolytic cells 11 , metal-air batteries 12 and devices for solar fuels 13, 14 .  In  all  these  applications, the reduction/oxidation (redox) of transition metal ions plays a critical role. For example, in Li-ion or Na-ion batteries, the charging/discharging ( i.e. Li + /Na + de-intercalation/intercalation) process is accompanied with the redox of transition metal ions in bulk. 1, 3 On the other hand, in fuel cells or electrolytic cells, catalysis of ORR/OER involves the  redox  of  transition  metal  oxides  on  or  near  the  surface 6,  15 .  Understanding  the  redox processes in metal oxides could provide a powerful tool for controlling the potentials at which charge/energy  can  be  stored  in  batteries  as  well  as  their  capacities,  and  for  enhancing  the efficiency of the energy conversion devices by improving the activity of OER/ORR catalysts. One  effective  way  to  adjust  the  redox  process  in  transition  metal  oxides  is  through  the substitution of metal ions, which is also a common strategy used to tune Li + /Na + intercalation voltages  16-18 and to increase the OER/ORR catalytic activity 15, 19-26 . However, a universal and fundamental understanding of the foreign metal substitution effect to the redox process across these different applications is still missing.

In this review, we bridge the studies of redox processes associated with metal substitution in the fields of inorganic molecular chemistry and Li-ion battery materials, which is reasonably understood, with those in electrocatalysis via the chemical physics of metal complexes and oxides by introducing a unifying concept of electronic levels on the absolute energy scale. Redox processes in transition metal oxides can be probed by electrochemical measurements, synchrotron  X-ray  absorption  spectroscopy  (XAS) 26, 27 ,  Raman  spectroscopy 28,  29 ,  electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) 30 , X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) 31, 32  and density function theory (DFT) studies 33-35 . Among all these techniques, electrochemical methods such as cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic measurements are simple but informative in situ to  provide  the  thermodynamic  and  kinetic  information  about  redox  processes  in  transition metal complexes and oxides.

In this work, we show that measuring the redox potential of metal complexes and oxides can be a powerful approach to reveal the inductive effect associated with metal substitution, and to guide  the  design  of  metal  complexes  and  oxides  for  electrochemical  energy  storage  and conversion  applications.  In  the  following  section  6.2,  we  discuss  that  the  inductive  effect associated with metal substitution can be used as a universal concept to rationalize and predict the redox potential changes reported in metal complexes 36, 37 , metal (hydr-)oxides 19, 38 ,  and lithium intercalation oxides 39-41  by altering the energy levels associated with filled antibonding states of metal-oxygen bonds. Then in section 6.3, it will be demonstrated that substitution with metal ions possessing higher electronegativity in transition metal complexes and oxides correlates with increased thermodynamic redox potentials, which is accompanied with more

electron  density  drawn  away  from  parent  metal,  and  the  formation  of  less  covalent  bonds between parent metal and ligand. In section 6.4, we show and discuss examples that positive shift of redox potentials in transition metal complexes and oxides caused by the inductive effect can  lead  to  enhanced  ORR/OER  activity,  which  can  be  attributed  to  reduced  adsorption strength of oxygenated species (since they are mostly on the ascending portion of OER/ORR volcano,  where  weaker  surface  adsorption  leads  to  higher  activity).  Such  tuning  of  redox potential and ORR/OER activity by the inductive effect not only provides new insights into reaction mechanisms on metal oxides, but also represents a conceptually new strategy for the materials  engineering  and  open  new  avenues  for  experimental  and  computational  studies devoted to the development of new materials.

## 6.2 Inductive effect in metal complex and metal oxides

The inductive effect is defined by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) as 'transmission of charge through a chain of atoms by electrostatic induction' 42 , and was introduced into the field of organic chemistry in the 1960s to explain the polarization of  molecules  upon  introduction  of  substituents  into  hydrocarbon  chain 43,  44 .  The  inductive effect is also used by Goodenough et al. in the 1990s to rationalize the influence of anions on the lithium intercalation voltage of lithium transition metal compounds 45-48  such as Li M PO4 and Li3 M 2( X O4)3 (having X = P, S, Mo, and As). High covalency of X -O bond in lithium metal phosphates can lower the covalency of neighboring M -O bond through the inductive effect, which  would  lower  the  electron  energy  of  filled  antibonding  states  and  increase  lithium intercalation  voltage  relative  to  lithium  metal  oxides  with  nominally  identical  metal  redox couples. 45-48  For instance, upon replacement of phosphorous with more electronegative sulfur in Li3Fe2(PO4)3, the effective charge of M increases (lowering MO covalency) as sulfur would

withdraw more electron density in X -OM ,  which  is  accompanied  with  increase  in  lithium intercalation voltage from 2.8 to 3.6 V vs. Li (VLi) correspond to Fe 2+ /Fe 3+ redox couple 47 . Overall, by affecting the electronic structure, the inductive effect has a direct influence on the redox  potential  of  transition  metal  ions.  However,  since  it  can  also  be  affected  by  other substitution-related factors, such as changes in the morphology and crystal structure, oxidation state of the parent metal, active site and reaction mechanism changes, etc., in this review we will focus on the previous studies reporting on electrochemical characterizations of the systems where contribution of those effects other than the inductive effect is negligible.

More recently, this inductive effect is manifested in systematic shifts in the redox potential of [ X Mn3O4]-containing  and  [ X Fe3O(OH)]-containing  organometallic  complexes 36,  37,  49,  50 (Figure 6-1(A)), investigated as a mimic for the [Mn4CaO5] active site 51, 52  in the biological oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) of photosystem II (PSII). In [ X Mn3O4] 36  and [ X Fe3O(OH)] 37 metal complex systems, substituents that are more acidic than Ca 2+  ( e.g. X n+ = Zn 2+ or Sc 3+ ) cause a positive shift in the Mn 3+ /Mn 4+  and Fe 2+ /Fe 3+  redox potential, as shown in Figures 61(B) and 6-1(C). These potential shifts linearly scale with the pKa value of [ X (H2O)m] n+  (Figure 6-1(D)), where pKa is equal to -log(Ka) and Ka is the equilibrium constant for water ligand deprotonation in [ X (H2O)m] n+  ([ X (H2O)m] n+ = H + + [ X (H2O)m-1(OH)] (n-1)+ ). Lewis acidity of the hydrated metal cation is essentially a way to define its electronegativity, and represents a direct measure of the strength of inductive effect felt by adjacent atoms: more electronegative cations form more covalent M -OH2 bonds in [ X (H2O)x] n+  and polarize water O-H bonds more strongly, making them more ionic and more prone to dissociation, or more acidic (decreased pKa). This trend is further supported by recent computational studies showing that substitution with more

acidic ions leads to higher ionization energies 53 .

To facilitate  the  understanding  of  the  redox  potentials  observed  in  the  fields  of  molecular chemistry,  electrochemistry  and  oxide  physics,  we  examined  whether  a  common  physical origin can be found for oxygen-containing metal complexes and oxides. First we aligned the electrode  scales  of  Fc/Fc +   (used  commonly  in  electrochemistry  of  molecular  compounds), H2/H +  (reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE, used in electrocatalysis) and Li/Li +  (used in Liion battery studies) scales to the absolute electron energy, as shown in Figure 6-2(A). Electrode potentials reported for the redox of select metal complexes referenced to Fc/Fc + , are aligned

with those of select metal (hydr-)oxides explored as catalysts for water splitting 56, 57 and as electrochemical  capacitors  (referenced  to  RHE),  and  of  transition  metal  in  lithium-ion intercalating materials for Li-ion batteries (referenced to Li/Li + ). 48, 58  Such alignment allowed us  to  note  that  the  redox  of  metal-oxygen-containing  complexes  ( e.g. Fe +3 2Fe +2 O(OH) = Fe +3 3O(OH) + e -37 ), hydroxide-mediated deprotonation/protonation in metal oxyhydroxides  56, 57  (e.g. NiOOH = NiOOH1x + x H + + x e ) and lithium de-intercalation/intercalation in metal oxides (e.g. LiCoO2 = Li1x CoO2 + x Li + + x e ) could occur in similar electron energy levels. Due to increased hybridization between transition metal and ligand, which can create ligand hole for late transition metal ions ( e.g. Ni 3+ , Ni 4+ and Co 4+ ) 59-61 , redox of these late transition metal compounds can involve both metal and ligands.

Metal substitution in transition metal complexes and oxides can result in the redistribution of an electronic density between metal and ligand. 53 The hybridization of the metal ( M ) d orbitals and ligand such as O 2 p orbitals occur due to the spatial overlap and energetic similarity of the electronic  states,  which  result  in σ -bonding  states,  with  largely  oxygen  character,  and σ *-antibonding states with largely metal character 62 , as shown in Figure 6-2(B) center. Some O 2 p states (lighter pink in Figure 6-2(B) center) do not hybridize with metal d states and thus form  nominally  non-bonding  ( σ 0)  states.  These  molecular  orbitals  become  bands  in  oxide crystals due to the translational symmetry of the unit cell, resulting in an M d band and O 2 p band, as shown on the left or right side of Figure 6-2(B).

Metal substituents ( X n+ )  with higher affinity to electrons (with higher electronegativity 63 or stronger  Lewis  acids)  than  parent  metal  ( M m+ )  can  pull  electrons  from M m+   and  lower  the

energy of antibonding states, which would lower the electron energy associated with the redox of M -ligand bonds, and shift the electrode potential positively. An electrode potential shift caused by the inductive effect can be as high as ~1 V, as shown in Figure 6-2(A). The molecular orbital diagrams of M -OM and X -OM are shown in Figure 6-2(B) center, where substituent X n+ has higher electronegativity than parent M m+ . X n+ with higher electronegativity lies lower on the electron  energy  scale  than  that  of M m+ ,  which  could  lead  to  the  formation  of  more covalent X -O bond, having a larger energy separation between the bonding and antibonding orbitals than M -O. The bonding orbitals of X -O can be further hybridized with M m+  in X -OM to form M -O bonds adjacent to X -O, where antibonding states have lower electron energy, and M -O bonds in X -OM are less covalent. Forming extended lattice with these bonds would give rise to narrower d states and lower electron energy for the valence band top edge compared with the non-substituted case, as shown in Figure 6-2(B) (left and right sides). On the other hand, metal substituents with lower affinity to electron density can donate electrons to parent metal, and increase the filling of antibonding states, which would increase the electron energy for redox of parent metal ions and shift the electrode potential negatively.

Conversions  between  scales  were performed using equations: E (vs. vacuum) = [E (vs. RHE, pH=14) + 4.44 - 0.059·pH] eV 64 and E (vs. vacuum) = [E (vs. Fc/Fc + ) + 0.624 + 4.44] eV 54 . Aligning Li/Li + scale with respect to the vacuum was conducted by aligning the redox transition of LiCo 3+ O2/Co 4+ O2 (~ 4 V vs. Li/Li + ) with the same Co 3+ /Co 4+  transition in Co (hydr-)oxides (~ 1.4 V vs. RHE, pH = 14). This conversion can be approximately expressed by E (vs. vacuum) = [E (Li/Li + ) +1.0] eV.

The  filling  of  metal antibonding  states  is  arbitrary  but  kept  the  same  for  both  scenarios.  Discrete  bonding, nonbonding and antibonding states are depicted in solid lines. The nonbonding and antibonding states are also shown as several single broad bands (dashed lines). For more electronegative X n+ ,  forming  more  covalent  bond  with  oxygen  than M m+ ,  the  energy  separation  between antibonding and bonding state (ΔE X -O) is higher than that of M -O bond (ΔE M -O). By substituting X n+ , M -O( X ) bond gains more ionic character than for the non-substituted case, resulting in a smaller energy separation between bonding and antibonding orbitals (ΔE M -O( X )) compared with the unsubstituted case.

In  this  section,  we  have  demonstrated  that  metal  substituents  ( X n+ )  with  higher  affinity  to electrons (i.e. with higher electronegativity or stronger Lewis acids) than the parent metal ( M m+ ) can  lower  the  energy  of  the  antibonding  state,  thus  increasing  the  voltage  of  the  redox transitions. In the following sections, we will apply the inductive effect concept established for redox processes in metal complexes and lithium metal oxides to the surface redox potential changes in Ni, Co, and Fe-based (hydr-)oxides and complexes used for catalyzing ORR/OER. Implications of redox potential tuning through the inductive effect on the ORR/OER activity are discussed.

## 6.3 Inductive tuning of redox potentials

## 6.3.1 Ni-based oxides

Corrigan and Bendert 67  have systematically shown that metal substitution such as Ce and Zn  in  electrodeposited  Ni(OH)2  can  promote  the  OER  kinetics.  The  enhanced  OER kinetics is accompanied with a positive shift in the potential of a reversible process for the oxidation of Ni(OH)2 prior to the onset of OER 67 . This redox process (centered at ~ 1.4 V vs. RHE (VRHE) and involving 1.6 electron per Ni(OH)2) has been attributed to hydroxide-mediated  deprotonation/protonation  or  proton  de-intercalation/intercalation

from/into Ni(OH)2 67 , involving Ni(OH)2 + OH -→ NiOOH + H2O + e -  and NiOOH + x OH -→ NiO1+ x (OH)1x + x H2O + x e processes 68-70 .  Although some studies 71-78 have assigned this peak as the Ni 2+ /Ni 3+  redox between Ni 2+ (OH)2 and Ni 3+ OOH, there is a compelling  evidence  to  support  the  involvement  of  nominal  Ni 4+ and  oxygen  redox accompanied  with  nominal  Ni 4+ ,  which  is  supported  by  recent  X-ray  near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) measurements of bulk Ni oxidation state (reaching ~3.6+) 79-82 . The participation of oxygen redox associated with nominal Ni 3+ /Ni 4+  transition can be explained by its electron energy pinned on top of oxygen p -band, which is also supported by severe oxygen loss associated with Li-ion battery material Li x Ni 3+ O2 upon lithium deintercalation. 83 The role of metal substitution on the shift of the redox process centered at  ~1.4  VRHE 67 and  the  OER  kinetics  is  further  confirmed  by  recent  comprehensive studies from Boettcher et al. 19   For example, the redox peak center was found to shift positively with metal substitution in an increasing order from La 3+ , Ce 3+ , Ti 4+ and Fe 3+ , as shown in the cyclic voltammetry data in Figure 6-3(C). Although it has been proposed that metal substitution-induced shifts in the redox potential centered at ~1.4 VRHE may arise from an electronic structure changes 67 , details are not known to date.

Here we employ the inductive effect concept illustrated in Figure 6-2(B) to explain the shift in the redox potential previously observed for metal-substituted Ni(OH)2 19, 67 . We found that the redox weighted center position extracted from Figure 6-3(C), representing the  formal  potential,  shifted  positively  with  greater  electron  withdrawing  power  of substituting ions ( X n+ ) manifested in increased electronegativity of X n+ 85  (Figure 6-3(E1)). Greater electronegativity of substituting metal ions can lower Ni 3+/4+ -O covalency

associated  with X -OM bonds  (Figure  6-2(B)),  which  would  lead  to  lowering  of  the electron energy for the top of valence band and increase the potential for the protoncoupled electron transfer relative to RHE scale. Moreover, the redox peak center shifts positively with decreasing pKa (increased Lewis acidity) of corresponding hydrated ions [ X (H2O)m] n+ 86 in Figure 6-3(E-2), which is similar to the trends discussed previously for the redox of metal complexes (Figure 6-1(D)). The oxidation states of substituting metal ions (La 3+ , Ce 3+ , Fe 3+ , Ti 4+  and Mn 2+ ) used in Figure 6-3(E) were chosen based on the oxidation  states  of  precursors  used  for  the  synthesis  of  metal-substituted  nickel hydroxide. (due to uncertainty about the oxidation state of Mn in a film, this data point was excluded from analysis)

Similar correlations were observed for X NiO3-d perovskites (Figure 6-3(D)) known to be highly active for OER 91 . A redox process centered at ~1.4 VRHE was observed for X NiO3 similar to Ni(OH)2, which can be attributed to hydroxide-mediated oxidation/deprotonation of X -substituted Ni(OH)2 associated with the surface transformation of X NiO3 at OER potentials. This hypothesis is supported by previous studies of (Ba,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3-d (BSCF) perovskites with similar O p-band center to X NiO3 92 , which can transform into layered oxyhydroxides at OER potentials 93, 94 . It should be noted that distinguishable peaks were not observed in X MnO3-d  95 , X FeO3-d  93, 95, 96 or X CoO3-d  15, 93 ( X =  La  and/or Sr) with lower O p band centers than BSCF. For these systems, the larger distance between Fermi level and O p band center make the surface structure of these oxides more rigid in the electrolyte remain crystalline and have low oxygen vacancy concentration, without transformation to layered oxyhydroxides up to

OER  potentials,  and  therefore  with  no  detectable  redox  peaks  observed  from  CV. Remarkably,  the  redox  peak  potential  was  found  to  shift  positively  with  increasing electronegativity of X n+ (Figure 6-3(F-1)), decreasing pKa of [ X (H2O)m] n+  (Figure 6-3(F2)) and X ionic size (Figure 6-3(F-3)) in the order from La &lt; Sm &lt; Pr &lt; Gd &lt; Eu. This trend  can  be  rationalized  by  the  inductive  effect  with  different  A-site  ions  in  the perovskite structure, which is supported by slightly reduced oxygen K-edge XAS prepeak width (ligand hole) from La, Pr, Sm, Eu to Gd. 97, 98  Notably, the positive redox potential shift with decreased X n+ ionic size (Figure 6-3(F-3)) most probably originates from  the  correlations  between  size  and  electronegativity  in  a  row  of  lanthanides: elements with smaller ionic size typically possess higher electronegativity.

## 6.3.2 Co-based oxides

Here we further compare the redox processes observed for Ni-based oxides with those of Co-based oxides. In contrast to Ni-based oxides shown in Figure 6-3, having one set of redox peak at ~1.4 VRHE, Co-based oxides and phosphates can exhibit two sets of redox peaks in the voltage range of 1-1.6 VRHE, as shown in Figure 6-4(A). For example, the cyclic voltammetry data of layered LiCoO2  99  (space group R3 F m )  and  Na0.7CoO2 (space group P63/mmc) exhibit two redox peaks at ~1.1 and ~1.4 VRHE. It is proposed that both redox processes can be attributed to hydroxide-mediated deprotonation/protonation coupled  with nominal  Co 3+ /Co 4+ redox in Co 3+ OO(H, Li/Na) 15,  100-102 .  This  assignment  is  supported  by  the  voltage  plateaus  of  oxygen intercalation into oxygen-deficient perovskites in the voltage range of 1.2 to 1.4 VRHE, as shown in Figure 6-4(B). These plateaus are associated with oxygen vacancy filling via SrCoO3-δ + 2δOH -→ SrCoO3 + δH2O + 2δe - ) 103, 104  driven by the energy difference between the H2O/H2 redox couple and the Co 3 d states near the Fermi level of SrCoO3-δ (Figure 6-2(A)). Further support for the Co 3+ /Co 4+  redox at these potentials came from lithium de-intercalation/intercalation into LiCoO2 39-41 , which occurs in the range from ~ 4.0 to ~ 4.5 VLi/Li+ corresponding to 1.0 to 1.5 VRHE (Figure 6-1). Unlike LiCoO2 and Na0.7CoO2, LiCoPO4, CoOOH 38  and Fe-substituted CoOOH 38  only show one redox peak at  ~1.1  VRHE  (Figure  6-4(A)).  Lack  of  structures  capable  of  hydroxide-mediated deprotonation/protonation at 1.4 VRHE might be responsible for the difference, which requires further studies.

Although systematic metal substitution was found for CoOOH 38 , data available did not allow  the  extraction  of  formal  potentials  as  shown  for  Ni(OH)2  in  Figure  6-3. Nevertheless, we found that reversible voltages of lithium de-intercalation/intercalation in LiCox X 1-xO2 reported previously could also be tuned by the inductive effect associated with X substitution  of  Co.  The  voltages  of  LiCox X 1-xO2 were found to increase with increasing  electronegativity  of X (Figure  6-5(A-1))  and  with  decreasing  pKa  of  the corresponding  substituent  (Figure  6-5(A-2)),  exhibiting  similar trends  found  for substituted Ni(OH)2 in Figure 6-3. Substituents X such  as  Mg 2+ and  Zn 2+ with  lower electronegativity compared with Co 3+  increase the covalency of M-O in X -O-M relative to M-O-M, which raises the electron energy of valence band top edge of LiCo1-x X xO2 and decrease the electron energy or potential difference relative to Li/Li +  (or lithium intercalation voltage).

The voltage plateau positions were extracted from previous work, 105  using the methods described in the methodology section shown schematically in Figure E4 in the Appendix E. The raw data used for the analysis are shown in Figure E5 in Appendix E. For all data points, the position of the voltage plateau was estimated as an onset of the lithium deintercalation/intercalation current.

## 6.3.3 Fe-based oxides

Although no systematic studies on the effect of metal substitution were found in literature for Fe(OH)2 or FeOOH, metal substitution in LiFex X 1-xPO4 105 ( X n+ = Ni 2+ , Mg 2+ , Al 3+ , V 3+ )  led  to  similar  trends  in  the  lithium  de-intercalation/intercalation  voltage  as  a function of X n+ electronegativity and pKa of [ X (H2O)m] n+ . Lithium deintercalation/intercalation  associated  with  the  LiFe 2+ PO4/Fe 3+ PO4 redox  occurs  at  3.5

VLi/Li+ 106 , which compares well with the potentials of Fe 2+ /Fe 3+  redox associated with Febased  complexes  discussed  in  Figure  6-1  (e.g.  ~1.0  VRHE-pH14  or  ~3.9  VLi/Li+  for [CaFe +3 3O(OH)] and [SrFe +3 3O(OH)]) and the potential of oxygen insertion in SrFeO3-δ shown in Figure 6-4(B) (~1.1 VRHE-pH14 or ~4.0 VLi/Li+). Substituting Fe with ions with higher electronegativity (Figure 6-5(B-1)) or lower pKa of [ X (H2O)m] n+  (Figure 6-5(B2))  leads  to  increased  intercalation  voltages.  Such  trends  can  be  explained  by  the inductive  effect,  whereby  substitution  of  Fe 2+ with X n+ characterized  with  higher electronegativity  lowers  Fe-O  covalency  for X -O-Fe bonds, and increase lithium  deintercalation/intercalation voltage for LiFex X 1-xPO4  105 . However, we should note that in the  case  of  a  small  difference  in  electronegativity,  the  inductive  effect  can  be overweighed  by  the  lattice  parameters,  intercalation  kinetics  and  phase  miscibility. Muraliganth et al. have reported that by substitution of Fe 2+ by less electronegative Mn 2+ in the LiFePO4 system, the Li-intercalation voltage is actually increased, which can be attributed to the significantly larger ionic radius of Mn 2+ that causes stretching of the FeO bond, thus decreasing its covalency. 107  They have also pointed out that the inductive effect is also violated by substituting Mg 2+ , which might be attributed to single-phase reaction behavior in contrast with the two-phase reaction behavior in other substituted systems. 107, 108

From the above discussion, it follows that the electrochemical measurements of metal redox potentials is an effective way to reveal and quantify the influence of the inductive effect on electronic structures of metal centers in metal-substituted Ni-, Co-, and Febased (hydr-)oxides. In the following section, we show that that the redox potential shifts

originated from the inductive effect can also be used to predict and tune the ORR and OER kinetics on the corresponding metal-substituted (hydr-)oxides

## 6.4 Implications of redox potential tuning for ORR and OER kinetics

Here we discuss that tuning the potential of redox events adjacent to ORR/OER can be used to enhance ORR/OER activity of catalysts. Conventional ORR and OER mechanism on oxides from  previous  experimental  and  computational  studies  involves  four  consecutive  protoncoupled electron transfer steps occurring on single metal sites 27, 109-111 or adjacent metal sites 112, 113 . In the case of ORR/OER in basic solution, molecular oxygen or OH -  from the electrolyte and electron interact with surface metal sites to create four different oxygenated adsorbates such  as  O2,  OOH,  O  and  OH,  where  surface  M  sites  can  be  oxidized  or  reduced  (formal oxidation state of the metal switches between n+ and n+1), as shown in Figure 6-7(A) for ORR and in Figure 6-8(A) for OER. The pioneering DFT works by Nørskov et  al. 110, 114-117 had established a universal framework for ORR/OER kinetics on metal and metal oxides surfaces. As the binding energies of  different  reaction  intermediate  species  are  correlated 118,  119 ,  the ORR/OER activity can be described by the probability to overcome the largest thermodynamic barrier associated with the rate-limiting step. In the conventional mechanism, the ORR/OER activity of metal oxides scales with the free energy of adsorbates such as ΔGOad  109 or ΔGOad ΔGOHad  110 (referred to as activity descriptor), exhibiting a volcano shape 109, 110, 118 , with highest activity  corresponding  to    the  intermediate  binding  strength  of  the  reaction  intermediates. Unfortunately,  the  free  energies  of  adsorption,  the  key  to  bridging  experimental  and computational results of ORR/ORR, are difficult to access experimentally.

The term ΔGOad - ΔGOHad  110  introduced as an activity descriptor from DFT studies, is directly

related to the redox potentials of metal oxides prior to ORR/OER. For example, the free energy of the proton-coupled electron transfer step, [ M n+ -OH] → [ M n+1 -O] + H +  + e -in acid or [ M n+ OH] + OH -→ [ M n+1 -O] + H2O + e -  in basic solution (step n = 3 in Figure 6-7(A) and step n = 1 in Figure 6-8(A)), can be expressed as   ΔGn = ΔGOad - ΔGOHad - eURHE, where ΔGOad and ΔGOHad  are  the  free  energies  of  adsorption  of  Oad  ( M n+1 -Oad)  and  OHad  ( M n+ -OHad), respectively. 110 Therefore,  the  experimentally observed potential of [ M n+ -OHad]/[ M n+1 -Oad] redox couple prior to ORR/OER might relate to the computational activity descriptor: ΔGOad ΔGOHad  =  eURHE.  Kuo et  al. 121 ,  have  first  used  this  approach  to  correlate  OER  activity  at different pH with estimated ΔGOad - ΔGOHad from the experimental redox potential (~ 1.5 VRHE at  pH  13)  measured  for  the  IrO2  (110)  surface.  In  the  section  6.4.2  we  will  discuss  the limitations of this approach caused by difficulties of the assignment of redox transition prior to a catalytic event.

## 6.4.1 ORR activity

We seek to correlate the potential of redox transitions of metal oxides with ORR activity due  to  its  simplicity  relative  to  previously  reported  activity  descriptors  for  ORR. Previous work has shown that the intrinsic activity of oxides can exhibit a volcano trend 27 as a function of the antibonding ('eg') orbital filling 122-124 of surface transition metal ions, where having antibonding orbital filling of zero/two can lead to too strong/weak binding of reaction intermediates and having 'eg' close to 1 renders optimum binding and high ORR activity. Such argument is in agreement with computational studies of metal oxides, which  show  that  the  maximum  ORR  activity  is  to  be  observed  when  binding  of oxygenated species such as O2, OOH, O and OH neither too strong nor too weak on the surface metal ions 109 . Moreover, increasing metal-oxygen covalency of metal oxides is

shown to increase ORR activity for metal oxides with 'eg' filling of ~1 27 . Unfortunately these activity descriptors were estimated from previous ex situ measurements of 'eg' filling or obtained from computed binding energies of oxygenated species on the surface.

The potentials of redox transitions in metal oxides can scale with the binding energies of oxygenated species and correlate with ORR activity. This hypothesis is supported by a recent  study  of  ORR  activity  of  metal-nitrogen-based  catalysts  involving  moieties containing a metal center coordinated by four pyrrolic nitrogen atoms (MN4), as shown in Figure 6-6(A) and 6-6(B). Increasing the experimental redox potential of M 2+ /M 3+ couple for these MN4 catalysts is shown to scale with decreasing the computed binding energy of oxygen, which leads to increasing ORR activity, as shown in Figure 6-6(B). 125 The highest ORR activities can be obtained for M 2+ /M 3+  redox potentials around +1.2 VRHE (pH = 13) for metal phthalocyanines ( M Pc) when M = Fe 126 .

RHE for different Fe-based catalysts  125 .

ORR activity of inverse spinels [ X xFe 2+ 1-x]oct[Fe 3+ ]tetra[Fe 3+ ]octO4 ( X = Mn) 127  in 0.1 M KOH was found to increase  with  greater  formal  potential  of  Fe 2+ /Fe 3+ redox  on  the octahedral site at ~0.5 VRHE, as shown in Figure 6-7(B). The anodic shift of Fe 2+ /Fe 3+ redox couple in a row of Mn-Fe spinels can be explained, in our opinion, analogously to the case of Li-intercalation potential changes in a row LiFe1-xMnxPO4 solid solutions (see discussion in Section 6.3.3), where structural effects were shown to dominate over inductive effect 107 . In the case of substituted Fe spinels, structural changes caused by Feto-Mn substitution might also affect the covalency of the Fe-O bond, thus shifting the potential in the anodic direction. Extending such a trend shown in Figure 6-7(B) to more substituents in [ X xFe 2+ 1-x]oct[Fe 3+ ]tetra[Fe 3+ ]octO4  127 was not possible due to lack of redox features reported. We correlated increasing ORR activity of [ X xFe 2+ 1x]oct[Fe 3+ ]tetra[Fe 3+ ]octO4 127 (Fe3O4,  Cu0.7Fe2.3O4,  Co0.8Fe2.2O4, and  Mn0.6Fe2.4O4)  and X Co2O4 128  (Co3O4, ZnCo2O4, NiCo2O4) spinels with decreasing electronegativity of X 2+ substituent  or  increasing  pKa  of  [ X (H2O)m] n+   (Figure  E12).  Following  the  concept  in Figures  6-1  -  6-3,  the  increasing  ORR  activity  should  scale  with  decreasing  redox potential  of  Fe 2+ /Fe 3+ ,  which  contrasts  with  that  in  Figure  6-7(B).  These  datapoints, however, might correspond to the descending portion of ORR volcano, where decreasing redox potential would lead to stronger binding and increased ORR activity, explaining the apparent discrepancy, however this requires further studies.

The weighted centers were calculated as schematically depicted in Figure E1-E3.

## 4.2 OER activity

Here we relate the OER activity of metal oxides to the potential of redox processes preceding OER, which also corresponds to the redox of surface metal ion sites, [ M n+ -OHad]/[ M n+1 -Oad] in the conventional mechanism, as shown in Figure 6-8(A). The OER activity of substituted nickel hydroxides (Figure 6-3(E)) was shown to increase with the greater potential of the redox event (at ~1.4 VRHE) upon substitution of metals with greater electronegativity, as shown in Figure 6-8(B). This trend is further supported by the results previously reported for Ni-Fe 80 (hydr-)oxides with different concentration of Fe substitution, where increasing OER activity is accompanied with increasing redox potentials, as shown in Figure 6-8(C). Further support came from correlations of increasing OER activity with increasing electronegativity of metal substituent in Ni(OH)2 and decreasing pKa from Mn 2+  to Fe 3+ (Figure E11). It was also recently demonstrated  that  oxidation  potential  (essentially  representing  another  measure  of  the

inductive effect strength) of the anionic species intercalated in Ni-Fe-LDH's also scales with the OER activity of the latter compounds. 129  These observations can be rationalized by the following arguments. Increasing the redox potential of the process centered at ~1.4 V, which has been assigned to Ni 3+ OOH + x OH -→ Ni 3+ x O1 +x (OH)1 -x + x H2O + x e ,  would  increase ΔGOad - ΔGOHad on surface Ni sites, and increase the OER activity by reducing the barrier associated with the rate-limiting step ([ M n+ -O] + OH -→ [ M n+1 -OOH] + e - ). X-ray spectroscopy measurements confirm involvement of Ni 4+  in this redox process. The work of Friebel et al. 87 shows OER-active species involving nominal Ni 4+  and Fe 3+  in (Ni,Fe)OOH, and Li et al . 130 report a maximum mixed-valence resting state of 3.6+ attained for Ni ions with 4 mol% Fe substitution.

In addition, recent XAS measurements 131  show that Ni oxidation state in Ni -Fe (hydr-)oxides is  lower  than  that  in  Ni-based  (hydr-)oxide  at  OER-relevant  potentials  (1.63  VRHE).  OER catalyzed by Ni -Fe (hydr-)oxides can involve more oxygen evolution associated with oxide lattice 80, 131 , thus deviating from the conventional mechanism, where reduction of nickel sites upon oxygen release may occur, competing with nickel oxidation during OER. Having filled metal antibonding states, such as those of nominal Ni 3+ / 4+ and Co 3+ / 4+ , falling below the top of O p-band would promote the mechanism of oxygen evolution involving oxide lattice, which is supported  by  recent  experimental  studies  for  SrCoO 3δ 15 .  Formation  of  tetravalent  nickel peroxide species (e.g. nominal Ni 4+ -OO) 87 further supports this mechanism. Moreover, Ni-Fe (hydr-)oxides exhibit pH-dependent activity on RHE scale, 131 which is typically accompanied with the involvement of the lattice oxygen in the OER 15, 132-134 ([O lattice ] + OH -→ [O lattice -OH ad ] + e -).  Altogether, this allows us to assume that high activity of Ni-Fe (hydr-)oxide systems

originates  from  its  functioning  through  the  OER  mechanism  involving  lattice  oxygen participation.

It  should  also  be  noted  that,  likewise  the  case  of  LiFex X 1-xPO4, discussed in section 6.3.3, influence of the inductive effect on an activity of material in OER can be overweighed by other factors.  For  example,  for  (Ln0.5Ba0.5)CoO3δ double  perovskites, 26 sit  was  shown  that  the change of the formal oxidation state of cobalt upon different Ln 3+  substitution is a primary factor defining the relative position of O p-band center and Fermi level in these materials, rather than changes of electronegativity/Lewis acididity of Ln 3+ .

The  weighted  centers  were calculated as schematically depicted in Figure E1-E3.

Although  the  OER  activity  of  metal  oxides  can  be  correlated  with  the  potential  of  redox

preceding OER (Figure 6-8), there is no good agreement between estimated values of ΔGOad ΔGOHad from the redox potential (eURHE) and ΔGOad - ΔGOHad computed with Generalized gradient approximation with Hubbard U applied (GGA+U) (Figure E13). For example, the experimental potential of the redox event for IrO2 (110) prior to OER occurs at ~1.5 VRHE 121 while that for RuO2 (110) 135, 136 takes place at a lower voltage, ~1.35 VRHE, which is typically assigned  to  [ M n+ -OH]/[ M n+1 -O]  or  [ M n+ -OH] =  [ M n+1 -O]  +  H + +  e -  137,  138 .  However  the computed value of ΔGO *  - ΔGOH *  on IrO2 (110) is lower than that of RuO2 (110) 109, 110 . The discrepancy can be attributed to the fact that the redox process preceding OER on metal oxide surfaces might not correspond to the transition from OHad to Oad, where the mechanistic details should be studied further in more details. For example, these redox transitions might not result in  a  complete  change of all OHad groups to Oad, and partial coverage may be stabilized at different potentials due to adsorbate interactions. Furthermore, interactions between surface adsorbed species can lead to different stabilized adsorbed intermediates at these potentials. 139 Further investigations on the nature of the redox active site and surface termination of oxides in situ during OER is critical in providing mechanistic details between redox peak positions and binding energetics of key OER intermediates, which could potentially provide exciting opportunities to affect OER activity by tuning the potentials of relevant redox events.

In general, the redox potential position can be used as an effective descriptor for the ORR/OER activity  of  metal-substituted  (hydr-)oxides  catalysts,  which  reflects  the  influence  of  the inductive effect of foreign metals on the electronic structure and thus to the surface oxygen adsorption  strength.  Shifting  the  redox  potential  closer  to  the  theoretical  OER  potential positively  often  lead  to  higher  catalytic  activity,  which  can  be  used  to  guide  the  metal substitution process to improve the performance of (hydr-)oxide catalysts performance .

## 6.5 Conclusions

In this review, we have examined the influence of the inductive effect associated with metal substitutions on the redox process of transition metals in metal complexes, lithium transition metal  oxides  and  Ni,  Co,  Fe-based  hydr-(oxides)  used  for  ORR/OER  electrocatalysis.  We introduce a universal origin for the inductive effect associated with metal substitutions in these systems.  Substitution  by  metal  ions  ( X n+ )  with  greater  electronegativity  and  lower  pKa  of [ X (H2O)m] n+  is shown to positively shift the formal redox potential of parent metal in transition metal complexes and (hydr-)oxides. Such observations can be rationalized by inductive effect: substitution with elements of higher electronegativity compared to parent metal would lead to lowering of the electron energy associated with the antibonding states of metal-ligand ( e.g. oxygen), which is accompanied with the shift of the electron density from parent metal to ligand. Moreover, tuning the redox potential of metal complexes and metal (hydr-)oxides can lead to greater ORR/OER activity, which can be attributed to optimized binding of the reaction intermediates  on  the  surface  in  rate-limiting  steps.  Such  findings  demonstrate  exciting opportunities to enhance the activity of catalysts by controlling redox processes adjacent to reactions of interest.

## 6.6 Methodology and measurements

The CV curves of nickel perovskite oxides in Figure 6-3(D) were measured using rotating disk electrode (RDE) setup in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte with the scan rate of 10 mV/s. The voltage loss from Ohmic resistance in these measurements have been corrected using E iR , where E is the measured voltage, i is the measured current, and R is the Ohmic resistance

measured by impedance. The weighted centers of oxidation and reduction processes in Figures 6-3(E)  and  6-3(F)  were  determined  by  applying  the  function  Vweighted  = ∫VdQ/∫dQ  on  the oxidation and reduction peaks respectively after the linear double-layer-capacitance background correction, where Q is the corresponding charge transfer at the voltage V in the redox process. Then the average value of the oxidation and reduction weighted centers was then used as the redox weighted center on the plots (see Figures E1-E3). The activity data and the position of the corresponding redox peaks for metal substituted compounds [L X Mn3O4(OAc)3(L´)x] n+ 36  , [L X Fe3O(OH)(OTf)y(L´)z] m+   37 , Ni(OH)2 19 , Co1-xFexOyHz  38 , Ni1xFexOyHz 80 , M xFe 2+ 1-xFe 3+ 2O4 127 , M Co2O4 128   were  extracted  from  literature  (detailed procedures are described in Appendix E, Figures E6-E8, E10). The first discharge curve of Liion battery materials from previous work  39-41, 105  was smoothened with moving average filter and the first derivative of the capacity with regard to voltage (dQ/dV) was taken, where the peak of dQ/dV was extracted as the Li-intercalation potential, this process is schematically shown in Figure E4 in the Appendix E, where all the raw data to generate Figure 6-4 is shown in Figure E5. For metal-substituted LiCoO2, since the charge profile in the first cycle was also available,  the  average  value  of  Li  intercalation/de-intercalation  voltage  was  taken  as  the intercalation voltage. The values of crystal radii of ions (designated as ionic radii throughout the paper) in Figures 6-3 were taken from Ref. 140 .

## Chapter 7 : Summary and Outlook

## 7.1 Conclusion

In this thesis, we have addressed the following questions: (1) what controls the redox process and  energy  density  of  positive  electrodes  materials,  (2)  what  controls  the  reversibility  of cationic and anionic redox and (3) how we can improve the energy density and cycling stability of current Li-ion positive electrode materials. In Chapter 2 and 3, by comparing the redox process  of  conventional  Li-stoichiometric  NMC  electrodes  with  Li-rich  ruthenates,  probed through  core-level  spectroscopy,  we  have  shown  that  high  covalent  nature  of  Ru-O  bond induces a bulk oxygen redox process, coupled with bulk Ru reduction upon charging. This observed process is fundamentally different from the surface oxygen release observed in Nirich NMC electrodes. This difference is rooted in the electronic structure between 3 d and 4 d transition metal oxides, where the density of states of 4 d transition metals are in general more delocalized, inducing a larger degree of energetic overlap between metal and oxygen and more covalent interaction, compared to 3 d transition metals.

In Chapter 4 and 5, we explored the electronic structure descriptors that controls the redox process of positive electrodes and how we could tune the electronic structures of oxides to control the redox process of positive electrode materials. We have demonstrated by anionic engineering to tailor the electronic structure of conventional NMC electrode materials, and as a result we are able to tune the reversibility of cationic redox process and improve the cycling stability of Ni-rich NMC. Moreover, by tuning the electronic structures, we are also able to tune the reversibility of bulk anionic redox, as shown in Chapter 5. Furthermore, we have proposed an electronic structure descriptor for anionic redox reversibility and to screen for

novel  positive  electrode  materials  of  higher  energy  density  and  higher  stability.  We  have shown that the energetic overlap between the transition metal and oxygen density of states near the  Fermi  level  dictate  both  the  surface  reactivity  as  well  as  the  redox  reversibility  of  the positive electrode materials.

This thesis has laid the foundation for future high-throughput computational and experimental screening for future energy storage materials that are not limited to battery applications but also to electrocatalysis, which also relies on transition metals going through redox transitions. In the next section, we will discuss some potential future directions following up this thesis work and some limitations that could be addressed in the future studies.

## 7.2Perspective

- 7.2.1 Computational and experimental screening for novel positive electrode materials leveraging anionic redox

Recent  advance  in  high-throughput  DFT  computations  gives  opportunities  to  screen through thousands of hypothetical compounds for desired properties for energy storage and conversion. Jain et al. 1  has employed high-throughput DFT calculations to screen through ternary and quaternary lithium metal oxides using 3 d metal redox center as the positive electrode materials, where they have screened through around 2000 compounds from Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD) for the intercalation potential, the thermal  stability  as  well  as  the  synthesizability  of  the  candidate  materials.  They approximated the thermal stability of the oxide based on the computed oxygen chemical potential, which is correlated with the onset temperature of oxygen release in Li metal oxides.  Moreover,  they  estimated  the  synthesizability  of  the  oxides  based  on  the

energetic difference between the proposed compounds and computed phase boundary, where  an  energetic  difference  lower  than  0.025  eV/atom  is  deemed  as  potentially synthesizable experimentally. Beyond novel positive electrode materials through highthroughput  screening,  researchers  have  also  used  the  high-throughput  framework  to screen through protective coating materials for positive electrode materials. Aykol et al. 2 screened  through  130,000  oxygen-bearing  materials  based  on  the  electrochemical stability  and  chemical  stability  against  HF,  a  common  side  product  in  the  liquid electrolyte  for  Li-ion  batteries.  They  approximated  the  chemical  stability  against  HF based  on  the  chemical  reaction  enthalpy  between  the  proposed  compound  and  HF. Recently,  researchers  have  also  employed  high-throughput  calculations  to  screen  for novel  Li-rich  materials  employing  anionic  redox. 3   They  used  the  computed  oxygen vacancy formation energy as a proxy to estimate the reversibility of anionic redox, based on the assumption that oxygen vacancy formation energy is correlated with amount of oxygen release and oxygen vacancy created. Most of those high-throughput studies used some type of approximations for a physical property observed experimentally to expedite the computational efficiency and reduce computational cost, yet those approximations are not necessarily verified through experimental studies. In this thesis, by quantifying the oxygen redox reversibility through experimental measurements, we have proposed a simple electronic structure descriptor, which can be computed easily through DFT and could be adapted into those established high-throughput frameworks for more accurate screening for high-energy positive electrodes.

The development of high-throughput experimentation tool also makes quick testing for the candidate chemistries possible. Sun et al. 4 recently have developed a high-throughput experimentation framework to automate the synthesis and characterization to identify perovskites  for  solar  cell  applications,  where  they  have  screened  through  75  new perovskite thin films and measured their performance in solar energy conversion. Highthroughput experimentally has increased the efficiency of new materials exploration by 10 times with more than 90% accuracy. Recently, Hitt et al. 5   has constructed a highthroughput framework to quickly electrochemically test 220 candidate materials on a grid  using  CO2  reduction  (CO2RR)  fluorescence  to  quickly  screen  through  for  their catalytic activity. In this work, they have identified two three ternary alloy composition which is five times more active than elemental Au as a CO2RR catalysis. Those highthroughput  experimentation  frameworks  proposed  in  the  recent  works  could  be combined with high-throughput computations, where we could experimentally test the actual feasibility and electrochemical performance of positive electrode materials prescreened by computations. By using the spectroscopy tools we have identified in Chapter 2  and  3,  we  can  conduct  detailed  study  and  tuning  of  those  novel  compounds  down selected by high-throughput experimentation and computation.

- 7.2.2 Stabilizing the positive electrode and electrolyte interface for higher cycling stability In Chapter 5, even though we have identified the factors controlling the reversibility of anionic redox in oxides by quantifying the oxygen release, yet the long term of oxide stability  upon  cycling  is  also  largely  dependent  on  the  interfacial  resistance  build-up between  oxide  and  liquid  electrolyte  upon  cycling.  In  our  recent  works 6 ,  we  have

combined  DRIFT,  Raman,  XPS  and  NMR  spectroscopies  with  DFT  calculations  to understand  the  electrolyte  solvent  and  salt  oxidation  on  charged  positive  electrode surfaces  of  NMC111,  NMC622  and  NMC811.  By  combining  Raman  and  DRIFT spectroscopies and DFT, we show evidences for the chemical oxidation of electrolyte solvents by EC dissociative adsorption on charged NMC, where EC dehydrogenate and yield surface protic species. This process is facilitated by highly reactive surface oxygen associated with highly covalent Ni-O of charged NMC. Combining XPS and DRIFT measurements  on  C-O  and  P-F  region,  we  show  that  the  solvent  oxidation  and  salt decomposition are coupled. As carbonate molecules dehydrogenate, the salt species also decompose to less coordinated P-F species by charging NMC622 and 811 but much less visibly for NMC111. These less coordinated P-F species include species such as PF3Olike and lithium nickel oxyfluoride species, and soluble HF and PF2O2 -in the electrolyte solution. We have shown that the driving force for electrolyte chemical oxidation via EC dehydrogenation  is  increased  by  lowering  the  Fermi  level  into  the  Op band  with increasing Ni and/or decreasing lithium content, and this electronic structure descriptor dictate the interfacial layer and impedance build-up upon cycling. However, we have not examined  if  Li-rich  positive  electrode  materials  follow  the  similar  pathway  as  we observed for Ni-rich NMCs, which should be understood in detail in follow-up studies to maintain cycling stability for Li-rich positive electrode materials.

Moreover, another common issue that Li-rich positive electrode materials face is the transition metal dissolution observed widely in Mn, Mo and Ru-based positive electrode materials.  Transition  metal  dissolution  could  be  potentially  mitigated  by  protective

coating as a physical barrier 7 , and/or by using concentrated electrolyte to increase the kinetic  barrier  of  metal  dissolution.  Takeda et  al. 8   have  shown  that  concentrated electrolyte (LiFSA:DMC = 1.1:1) could mitigate the Mo dissolution for Li2MoO3 based cathodes, which decrease the capacity degradation by 50% during the first 45 cycles, compared to conventional 1M LiPF6 /EC:DMC electrolyte. Detailed mechanistic study on those methods to improve the cycling stability of Li-rich positive electrode should be conducted in follow-up work.

## Supplementary Note A-1:

Assuming the starting oxidation state of Ni in NMC622 and 811 is 3+ (shown from comparison with LiNiO2 reference), and the highest obtainable Ni oxidation state is 4+, then Ni in NMC 622 and 811 can have the following redox capability:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

This can potentially sustain a Ni oxidation up to removing around 0.7 Li + /oxide.

Conversely, assuming the oxidation state of Mn and Co in NMC622 and 811 are fixed to 4+ and 3+, respectively (shown from comparison in Figure 2-2), and the highest obtainable Ni oxidation state is 4+, then Ni in NMC 622 and 811 have following oxidation state:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Therefore with this second assumption Ni in NMC 622 and 811 can have the following redox capability:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

This  can  also  potentially  sustain  a  Ni  oxidation  up  to  removing  around  0.7  Li + /oxide.  These calculations only apply to the bulk particle, yet the surface stoichiometry of NMC is not as perfect as what dictated in chemical formula, and the surface stoichiometry is quite important for the TEY data. Here we estimate the surface composition using XPS data.

From XPS, NMC 622 and NMC 811 has the following atomic percentage, where we can also calculate the Ni oxidation state based on the assumption that Mn is 4+ and Co is 3+:

|    | NMC622         | NMC622          | NMC811         | NMC811          |
|----|----------------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
|    | Atomic percent | Oxidation state | Atomic percent | Oxidation state |
| Co | 0.85%          | 3+              | 0.31%          | 3+              |
| Ni | 2.98%          | 1.98+           | 2.3%           | 1.82+           |
| Mn | 3.04%          | 4+              | 2.7%           | 4+              |

Therefore for the surface:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

This  is  way  beyond  the  electron  transfer  that  we  actually  need  to  perform  the  redox,  such unreasonable electron transfer is probably due to inaccurate Ni estimation from NMC surface from XPS as this estimation is based on the assumption that all surface Ni is in NMC, yet for Ni-rich NMC surface Ni could also come from surface Ni carbonate or Ni hydroxide, therefore we have a overestimation of Ni surface composition, and an underestimation of surface Ni starting oxidation state.

## Supplementary Note A-2:

This note summarizes the calculation details of estimating the level of surface reduction based on previous OEMS data from Jung et al. 6  We extracted amount of the O2 and CO2 release from the literature. We can then calculate the electron transfer associated with O2/CO2. (mole-/moloxides) as following:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where Mw represent the molecular weight of the oxides.

By assuming that the radius of the oxide particle is 7 𝜇𝑚 based on the microscopy images, the reduction is only limited to the 100 nm from the surface and the density of the particle is consistent across the particle, the electron transfer in the surface layer can be translated to:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Therefore, the level of nickel reduction is from 4+ can be calculated by:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- image -->

Therefore we can calculate the level of reduction of NMC811 and 622 summarized in the following table.

|         |   O 2 ( 𝜇 mol/m 2 ) |   CO 2 ( 𝜇 mol/ m 2 ) | BE T   | electron transfer O 2 (mol/mol)   | electron transfer CO 2 (mol/mol)   |   Ni reduction O 2 |   Ni reduction O 2 +CO 2 |

Similarly as in Ru L 3 -edge (Figure B7), we can note that as we introduce oxygen vacancies in the structure, in the O K-edge XAS, the e g peak  intensity  decreased,  while  creating  additional  feature  between  the  t 2g and  e g features at all lithium contents. In the simulated O K-edge XES, as we introduce oxygen vacancies, we only observed the shift of the non-bonding peak towards lower photon energy without creation of additional peak. Therefore, introduction of oxygen vacancies cannot explain the broadening we observed in the experimental XES data.

Figure B-8: Simulated Ru L-edge XAS spectra of Li 0 RuO 3 structure with oxygen-oxygen bond length of around 2.4 Å and hypothetical structures by forcing oxygen and oxygen bond length to 1.8 Å and 1.2 Å. We can note that as we introduce shorter oxygen-oxygen bond, the additional shoulder we observed at high photon energy representing O-O σ * feature shifted to higher energy, which  indicates  that  as  two  oxygen  atoms  are  forces  closer  together  the  (O-O) σ *  feature  is

destabilized. Moreover, by modulating the O-O bond length from 1.8 Å to 1.2 Å, the e g peak reduces in area compared to t 2g feature, which is not observed at high potentials in the experimental spectra in Figure 3-1(b) and 3-2(a), therefore in Li 2-x RuO 3 system, the creation of superoxo-species (with O-O bond distance less than 1.8 Å) is not likely or not stable to be observed.

For XAS, we note that as we shorten the oxygenoxygen bond, the additional shoulder we observed at high photon energy representing O-O σ * feature shifts to higher energy and increases in intensity (see also the Ru L-edge simulation as shown in Figure B8.) This indicates that as the two oxygens are forced to be closer together, the σ * feature is destabilized. Moreover, by modulating the O-O bond length from 1.8 Å to 1.2 Å, the e g peak drastically reduces in area compared to t 2g feature, which is not observed at high potentials in  the  experimental  spectra  in  Figure  3-1(a)  and  3-2(a).  Compared  to  the  XAS  spectra,  the computed  XES  spectra  is  more  sensitive  to  the  fluctuation  of  oxygen  bond  distance.  Upon decreasing the bond distance, there are more features observed in the XES spectra, potentially coming from the clear fingerprint of σ , 𝜋 , 𝜋 ∗ feature of the O-O bond due to stronger oxygen coupling. This splitting is not observed in the experimental spectra either. Therefore in Li 2-x RuO 3 system, the creation of superoxo- and peroxo-species (with O-O bond distance less than 1.5 Å) is not likely or not stable enough to be observed.

Figure B-10 Schematics of an example FWHM extraction of O K-edge XES spectra. The FWHM was estimated through the width of the center peak at half height since the center non-bonding peak is much taller than the shoulder peaks, therefore we assume the shoulder peaks evolution will not have significant effect on the full width half maximum of the center non-bonding peak.

Here, the FWHM was extracted based on the width at the half height of the most predominant peak (non-bonding peak) as the other shoulder peaks are much smaller than non-bonding peak, thus we assume that the shoulder peaks evolution  will  not  have  significant  effect  on  the  FWHM  of  the  center  non-bonding  peak,  the FWHM extraction procedure is also shown schematically in Figure B10.

Figure B-13: Ru K-edge XAS spectra (left) of pristine Li 2-x RuO 3 , and charged to 3.6 V Li , 3.8 V Li , 4.2 V Li , 4.4 V Li and 4.6 V Li , where the quantification of the K-edge energy is shown on the right. Here we can see that Ru K-edge shifted towards higher photon energy up to 3.8 V Li by removing around 1 lithium per formula unit, representing Ru 4+/5+ oxidation, and upon further lithium deintercalation the edge shifted toward lower photon energy as we charge up to 4.6 V Li creating small shoulder in the pre-peak region around 22125 eV, signalizing Ru reduction and Ru-O cage distortion. This observation matches with what we have observed in Figure 3-1 and Figure 3-2 in O K-edge, Ru L 3 -edge data and K-edge X-ray near edge absorption spectroscopy (XANES) data. All the data were aligned with a Ru metal foil reference channel. We should note that the data for Li 2-x RuO 3 charged to 3.6 V Li and 4.4 V Li (marked asterisk) were measured at a different beamtime, and had a slightly higher edge energy compared to the dashed line trend built by the other data even after reference channel alignment.

Regardless of method used to process the Ru L 3 -edge spectra to obtain the oxidation state of Ru, it always shows a monotonic oxidation up to 3.8 V Li and a slight reduction of Ru charging to 4.2 V Li and above. We should also note that the pre-peak centroid positions calculated from fitting are always slightly lower than that computed from simple integration method because the fitting of e g peaks do have more residuals compared to the fitting of t 2g peak, especially at high potentials, due to creation of high-photon energy features. To maintain consistency of fitting, we always fit only two peaks for the major two features observed in the raw spectra.

Figure B-17: Ru L 3 -edge XAS of charged Li 2-x RuO 3 composite electrodes in the first and third cycle. Despite a similar state of charge in the first and third cycle, Ru started in a much more reduced state in the third cycle, shown also in Figure 5. We note that this composite electrode is much more concentrated than the pellet we prepared for the oxide-only pellets shown in Figure 31. Therefore, in fluorescence mode there is a large self-absorption effect in the composite samples. The change in the peak shape is overwhelmed by the self-absorption effect and cannot be compared directly to the oxide-only result.

The edge energy onset is quantified in (f). Here, we observe that for Li2Ru0.75M0.25O3 (M= Mn,Ti), the bulk redox trend of Ru metal and substituent metal is not dependent on substituent metal that we studied in this work, and is quite similar to the redox process from previous study.

The S 0 2 are fixed due to the consideration that there is no significant amount of oxygen evolution and oxygen vacancy created upon Li deintercalation, as shown by DEMS in Figure 5-1. Therefore, for this fitting we fix the coordination number, and the detailed fitting is result is slightly different compared to our previous work on this material. (Ref. 32)

Figure E-3: Graphical representation of the calculations of the weighted center and average center position of redox peaks for LaNiO3. The curve was measured in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH, with a scan rate of 10 mV/s. The red regions and the red dash line represent the calculation method for the redox weighted centers. First, the linear double-layer-capacitance background corrections were applied  to  extract  the  oxidation  and  reduction  peaks,  respectively.  Second,  function  Vweighted = ∫VdQ/∫dQ was applied on the corrected oxidation and reduction peaks to calculate the oxidation and reduction weighted centers, where Q is the corresponding charge transfer at the voltage V in the redox process. At last, the average value of the oxidation and reduction weighted centers was used as the redox weighted center, which is the red dash line shown in the Figure. The purple dash lines on the left and right sides show the simple peak positions of the oxidation and reduction processes, while the central purple dash line represents the average center position of redox peaks.

Figure E-9: Estimation  of  the  reduction  and  oxidation  peak  position  for  MnxFe3-xO4  inversed spinels. Figures were taken from Ref. S6. The curves were measured in 0.1 KOH at the scan rate of 50 mV/s and with the oxides loading of 16 µg/cm 2 geo. The dash lines marked the oxidation and reduction peaks of each redox process. The average value between oxidation and reduction peaks was calculated and used as the Redox peak center on Figure 6-7(B) in the main text (the position of the more negative peak, corresponding to Fe 2+ /Fe 3+  redox, was considered). The peak at ca. -0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl was attributed to Fe 2+ /Fe 3+ redox because the area of the peak at ca. -0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl increases with greater Fe concentration (Mn content changes from 1 to 0.4). The peak at ca. 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl was attributed to Mn 2+ /Mn 3+ redox because the area of the peak at ca. 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl increases with greater Mn concentration (Mn content changes from 0.4 to 1).

Figure E-11: The relationship between the OER activity and the weighted center position of the Ni redox peaks, pKa of [Mn(H2O)m] 2+ , [La(H2O)m] 3+ , [Ce(H2O)m] 3+ , [Ti(H2O)m] 4+ ,[Fe(H2O)m] 3+ and electronegativity of the metal substituents in Ni1-x X xOyHz, where X = Mn 2+ , La 3+ , Ce 3+ , Ti 4+ and Fe 3+ .  The values of pKa were taken from Ref. S8. The electronegativity values were taken from Ref. S9. The OER activity was extracted using previous work [S1], where the measurements were performed for spin-cast films (4 - 5 μgoxide/cm 2 geo) in O2-saturated 1 M KOH, with the scan rate of 20 mV/s.

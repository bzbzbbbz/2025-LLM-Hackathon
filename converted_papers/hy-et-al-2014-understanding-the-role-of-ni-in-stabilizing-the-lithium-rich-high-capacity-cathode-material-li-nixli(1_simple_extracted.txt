ABSTRACT: The lithium-rich high-capacity cathode material Li[Ni x Li (1 -2 x )/3Mn(2 -x )/3]O2 was investigated by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to understand the role of Ni in the lithiumrich layered line in the pseudoternary system. The electronic structural changes that occur at di /uniFB00 erent charged states were examined with soft XAS to understand the role of the secondary transition metal in controlling the stability. The Mn L II,III -edges reveal a relationship between Ni and the degree of structural transformation after the /uniFB01 rst cycle. Close examination of Li2MnO3 shows that Mn changes its oxidation state slightly during charging; however, there is a more dramatic change upon reduction from 4+ to a value close to 3+ at discharge, where it participates in the subsequent charge-compensation mechanism. The Ni LII,III -edges reveal that nickel acts as

a stabilizer preventing the complete transformation of Mn by substitution reduction that is thought to couple with the anionic redox couple during the extended oxygen-activation plateau. The O K-edge reveals that loss of stability might be related to diminished d -sp hybridization occurring after oxygen activation, which is improved by the incorporation of nickel as a stabilizing agent. These /uniFB01 ndings clarify the complex relationships among nickel, manganese, and oxygen within lithium-rich high-capacity cathode materials in controlling stability while simultaneously obtaining high capacities exceeding 250 mA · h/g.

## ■ INTRODUCTION

The push for high-energy high-performing secondary lithium ion batteries (LIBs) will inevitably drive advances in the technologies supporting everything from portable devices to the entire spectrum of transportation. Lithium-rich highcapacity cathode (Li-excess) materials have recently generated great interest within the battery research and industry community. 1 Speci /uniFB01 cally, nickeland manganese-containing lithium-excess materials show the most promise for the next generation of high-energy rechargeable LIBs because of their high capacities and the abundance of manganese. These materials owe their high capacity to a dual compensation mechanism, involving the conventional solid-state redox-pair mechanism and an anionic redox-pair mechanism, where the latter involves the formation of peroxo or superoxo species that are dependent on the metal ligated with the species, ordering in honeycomb LiM2 layers, and hybridization between the metal and ligand. 2,3 However, the Li-excess materials su /uniFB00 er from voltage-fade, transition-metal dissolution, and structural changes with increasing numbers of cycles. 4 -12 A strong correlation was found between the reversible migration of transition-metal ions from the tetrahedral sites within the lithium layer during charging and return to the original octahedral sites (hysteresis process) during discharging and the irreversible movement of these metal ions into di /uniFB00 erent local cubic sites (voltage-fade process) occurring below 3.3 V during discharging. 7 This voltage-fade process continuously decreases the average open-circuit potential and thus presents a

signi /uniFB01 cant barrier to commercialization. 4,7,13,14 In addition, Kim et al. 6 and Croy et al. 4 both suggested that the nickel -manganese interaction within these materials plays a strong role in the stabilization that prevents the transformation to an ideal spinel con /uniFB01 guration. We have expanded upon previous studies and explored the di /uniFB00 erent roles of Ni within the lithium-rich layered line Li[Ni x Li (1 -2 x )/3Mn(2 -x )/3]O2 (LLNMO) within the Li -Ni -Mn oxide pseudoternary system. 15 We investigated the two end members (Li2MnO 3 and LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2) and Li 1.2 Ni0.2Mn0.6O2 by soft and hard X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and synchrotron X-ray di /uniFB00 raction (SXRD) in an attempt to establish relationships that govern structural stability within the lithium-rich layered tie line. In addition, we also attempted to clarify several of the processes occurring in the Li 2 MnO3 member that still remain elusive and link them to the processes occurring within Li 1.2 Ni0.2Mn0.6O2. 16 -18 Our results provide crucial insights into the interplay between the di /uniFB00 erent transition metals used to stabilize Li-excess cathode materials.

## ■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION

As in our previous report, 12 LLNMO materials with x = 0.5, 0.333, 0.25, 0.20, and 0.167 were synthesized by carbonate coprecipitation. Transition-metal sulfates and Na2CO3 were separately dissolved in deionized (DI) water. The mixed-metal sulfate solution was slowly

dripped into the Na2CO3 solution. After being stirred for 10 h, the solution was vacuum/uniFB01 ltered, washed with DI water, and dried overnight in a vacuum oven. The resulting precipitates were mixed with Li2CO3 and /uniFB01 red at 900 ° C for 12 h and then quenched to room temperature. Li2MnO3 ( x = 0) was synthesized by grinding MnCO3 and Li 2 CO3 in a Fritsch planetary ball mill for 1 h at 150 rpm and then annealing at 400 ° C for 32 h.

XAS spectra were obtained at the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC), Hsinchu, Taiwan, where the storage ring of the electronic accelerator can supply 1.5 GeV with an operating current of 360 mA. Hard X-ray absorption data for the Ni and Mn Kedges were collected at beamline BL17C. A Si double-crystal monochromator was used to perform the energy scan, in which the parallelism was adjusted to eliminate high-order harmonics. All of the spectra were recorded in transmission mode. Ionization chambers were used as detectors to monitor the intensity of the incident and transmitted beams through the specimen, thereby allowing the absorption coe /uniFB03 cient to be calculated from the logarithm of the intensity ratio of the incident and transmitted beams. Ni and Mn reference foils were positioned in front of the window of the third ionization chamber to allow for simultaneous measurement to act as a standard, that is, calibration energy, for each scan.

Soft X-ray absorption measurements were carried out at beamline BL20A1 in X-ray total electron yield (TEY) mode for the O K- and Mn LII,III -edges and in /uniFB02 uorescence yield (FY) mode for the Ni L II,III -and O K-edges using an ultrahigh-vacuum (UHV) chamber with a base pressure of 1 × 10 -10 Torr. A 6-m high-energy spherical grating monochromator (6m-HSGM) was used to perform the energy scan. The depths of /uniFB02 uorescence mode (giving bulk information) and total electron yield mode (giving surface information) were ∼ 200 and ∼ 10 nm, respectively, depending on the X-ray attenuation length. 19 All samples were transported and loaded into the chamber under an inert argon atmosphere to avoid exposure to the atmosphere. Samples were measured at multiple positions to check reproducibility.

## ■ RESULTS

Electrochemistry of LLNMO. Figure 1 shows the /uniFB01 rstcycle electrochemical charge/discharge curves of the two end members LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2 ( x = 0.5) and Li2MnO3 ( x = 0) and the nominal composition of Li1.2 Ni0.2Mn0.6O2 ( x = 0.2), along with the derivative plots. XRD and XAS analyses of the assynthesized powders of the di /uniFB00 erent compositions are provided in the Supporting Information. The numbers labeling the charge/discharge curves represent the di /uniFB00 erent voltage points where XANES analysis was performed. Voltage point 1 is the pristine state, voltage point 2 is a point before oxygen activation ( ∼ 4.45 V), where only the Ni 2+/4+ redox pair compensates the charge in the nickel-containing materials; voltage point 3 is the top of the charge (4.8 V) after the activation of oxygen; and voltage points 4 and 5 are the materials discharged to 3.5 and 2.0 V, respectively. As described in a previous report, the three compositions represent the pure oxygen-activating material (Li2MnO3), the pure solid-state redox reaction material (LiN0.5Mn0.5O2), and a combination of the two (Li 1.2 Ni0.2Mn0.6O2). 12 For Li2MnO3, the activation of oxygen will be followed by a structural rearrangement due to the extraction of the lithium from the ordered lithium and manganese superlattice occurring at ∼ 4.6 V. The observed reversible capacity was 73 mA · h/g, which is only 59% of the charge capacity. The corresponding d Q /d V plot shows that, upon discharge, a peak at ∼ 3 V was observed that can be attributed to the reduction of Mn from 4+ to 3+. For LiNi0.5 Mn0.5O2, the observed reversible capacity was 194 mA · h/ g, which is 81% of the charge capacity, where the higher reversibility is attributed to the reversible redox-pair reaction of Ni 2+/4+ that generally does not entail large structural rearrange-

ments. As seen in the corresponding d Q /d V plot, the dominant discharge peak shows an apex at ∼ 3.7 V that represents the Ni 4+/2+ redox pair with no signi /uniFB01 cant di /uniFB00 erence between charge and discharge curves. For Li 1.2 Ni0.2Mn0.6O2, dramatic di /uniFB00 erences can be seen between charging and discharging because of the activation of oxygen that is followed by structural rearrangement. The observed reversible capacity was 240 mA · h/g, which is 68% of the charge capacity. The corresponding d Q /d V plot shows that the charging process goes through the typical redox reaction (approximately 3.7 -4.4 V) and then through the oxygen-activation process (&gt;4.5 V). Upon discharging, the peaks representing the Ni 4+/2+ redox pair can be observed along with a slight shift toward lower voltage (apex of intense peak at ∼ 3.5 V) that represents a reduction of Mn 4+ to 3+.

Extended cycling was performed for the three compositions to observe and compare the changes after long cycling; see Figure 2. The three compositions were /uniFB01 rst cycled at a rate C / 20 ( C = 250 mA · h/g) for three cycles and then cycled at C /3. For Li 2 MnO3, when cycled for 50 cycles, the discharge capacity was 10 mA · h/g, which represents a drop to 40% of the fourthcycle discharge capacity when the higher-rate cycling began. For LiNi0.5 Mn0.5O2, there was a signi /uniFB01 cant drop in capacity when the higher-rate cycling began that might be due to high impedance stemming from high Ni/Li exchange (see Table S1, Supporting Information). The discharge capacity observed at 155 cycles was 44 mA · h/g, which is 47% of the fourth-cycle discharge capacity. In contrast, the Li 1.2 Ni0.2Mn0.6O2 composition showed a capacity of 71 mA · h/g, which is higher than that of LiNi 0.5 Mn0.5O2, but only 39% of the fourth-cycle discharge capacity, which is much lower in terms of retention as seen by the normalized capacity. The d Q /d V plots were examined after di /uniFB00 erent numbers of cycles for the three di /uniFB00 erent compositions to further assess the changes occurring upon extended cycling, as can be seen in Figure 3.

The d Q /d V plot for Li2MnO3 at the /uniFB01 fth cycle shows a peak with an apex at ∼ 2.8 V, which is 0.2 V from the original 3 V that was observed for the /uniFB01 rst-cycle discharge. In comparison, LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2 shows a peak with an apex at ∼ 3.7 V that is similar to the /uniFB01 rst-cycle discharge. Upon extended cycling, the peak moves from ∼ 3.7 to ∼ 3.5 and ∼ 3.25 V after the 50th and 100th cycles, respectively. This lowering of the voltage with extended cycling might be related to surface structural changes that are thought to occur due to repeated high-voltage cycling (&gt;4.6 V) and that have also been observed in classical layered materials. 20 For Li1.2 Ni0.2Mn0.6O2, the discharge peak reaches an apex at ∼ 3.2 V at the /uniFB01 fth cycle, which represents a 0.3 V di /uniFB00 erence from the /uniFB01 rst cycle. Upon extended cycling, the voltage moves to 3 and 2.75 V after the 50th and 100th cycles, respectively, resembling the Li2MnO3 after the /uniFB01 fth cycle. This dramatic change can be attributed to both the high-voltage cycling and the structural rearrangement that occurs after oxygen activation and the participation of oxygen in the subsequent cycling.

Electronic Structural Changes of LLNMO. FY and TEY O K-edge XANES spectra for Li2MnO3, Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2, and LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2 at di /uniFB00 erent voltage states are shown in Figure 4. The O K-edge XANES spectra can be split into two distinct regions: (1) the lower-energy region ( ≲ 535 eV, 3d band) that characterizes the O 2p orbital weight in states of predominantly transition-metal 3d orbital, where the lower-energy peak represents spin-down t 2g and majority spin-up eg and the higher-energy peak represent the remaining spin-down e g , and (2) the higher-energy region ( ≳ 535 eV, 4sp band) representing Op character (principal 2p) hybridized with transition-metal 4s and 4p states. 21 It should be noted that a peak was observed at ∼ 533 eV in both FY and TEY modes for the Li 2MnO3 material. This peak might be related to the low-temperature synthesis method or the speci /uniFB01 c size of the material compared to that employed in other studies. 22 In any case, this feature was observed for each spectrum of the Li2MnO3 composition, and the corresponding XRD (see Figure S1, Supporting Information), hard XAS (Figure S3, Supporting Information), electrochemistry, and Mn LII,III -edge XANES results correspond to the typical Li2MnO3 material. 17,23 -25

For FY mode, the most striking changes can be observed in the shift of the 4sp band to higher energy and the increase in the spectral weight of the pre-edge region for the 3d band, which can be a /uniFB00 ected by the number of d-hole states in the metal 3d orbitals and the covalency of the O 2p character in the antibonding metal 3d orbitals. 22 An increase of ∼ 11% for LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2 was observed that agrees well with a previous study. 22 Whereas an increase of ∼ 10% was observed for Li 1.2 Ni0.2Mn0.6O2, almost no increase was observed for Li2MnO3 ( ∼ 0.6%). This might be related to the greater e /uniFB00 ective nuclear charge of the higher-oxidation-state metal ions shifting the ligand pre-edge peak position to a lower energy, as the metal d orbitals are located at a deeper binding energy and are closer in energy to the ligand 1s orbital. 26

For Li2MnO3, the charge-compensation mechanism does not follow the conventional topotactic mechanism of a transitionmetal redox-pair; therefore, it is not unreasonable that no obvious increase in spectral weight was observed. For TEY mode, the e /uniFB00 ective pre-edge intensity showed variations similar to those of the corresponding FY spectra. The most dramatic changes in the TEY spectra were in the ratio between the 3d and 4sp band intensities. Whereas no major variations were observed for LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2, Li2MnO3 and Li 1.2 Ni0.2Mn0.6O2 exhibited decreases in the 3d relative band intensity compared to the 4sp band after the oxygen-activation plateau. This indicates a decrease in the number of unoccupied 3d states available for mixing with O 2p states, a /uniFB00 ecting the initial hybridization between metal 3d and oxygen 2p orbitals. 21,27 It is interesting to note that this behavior has been observed on the surfaces of other Li-rich materials by O K-edge XANES spectroscopy. 28,29

To assess the extent of this phenomenon, the 3d-to-4sp band intensity ratio was evaluated at di /uniFB00 erent voltage points and then normalized to the pristine state (see Figure 5), where voltage points refer to the points along the charge and discharge curve for each respective x value. Before the oxygen-activation region (voltage point 2), the 3d/4sp band intensity ratio dropped slightly in each case. At the end of charge (voltage point 3), after the oxygen-activation region, LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2 showed a slight increase above 1, whereas Li 2 MnO3 and Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2 showed decreases to ∼ 0.5 and ∼ 0.77, respectively. The increase in the intensity ratio for LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2 is related to the increase in the valence state of Ni from 2+ to 4+, where the increased oxidation state of the transition metal increases the hybridization between the metal 3d and oxygen 2p orbitals, which is thought to be due to the lower energy di /uniFB00 erence between the two, causing increased covalency. 27

In all cases, during discharging and in the discharged state (voltage points 4 and 5, respectively), the 3d/4sp band intensity decreased with decreasing Ni content; the most signi /uniFB01 cant drop was seen in Li 2 MnO3 with a value of 0.5. The consequences of this dramatic change in electronic structure are discussed further below. The surface species might make some contribution to the O K-edge XANES spectra, as these materials exhibit surface formations during and after cycling where the most signi /uniFB01 cant product formed is Li2CO3. 10,12,30,31

To determine whether any correlation is present between variations in the 3d/4sp band intensity ratio and the surface formation, C K-edge XANES spectroscopy (in TEY mode) was employed to observe the trend in Li2CO3 formation and consumption during charging and discharging and compare it to previous results. 10,12,31 As can be seen in Figure 6, the peak at ∼ 291 eV is related to Li 2 CO3 and can be seen to increase in intensity when the system was charged to 4.4 V. At 4.8 V, the intensity decreased close to the pristine state and increased again at the discharged state. This trend agrees well with

previous studies showing Li2CO3 growth during charging, decomposition at the 4.8 V charged state, and regrowth at the discharged state. 12,31 No correlation between the surface formation and 3d/4sp band intensity evolution was observed, implying that the trend in the changes in the 3d/4sp band intensity are related to changes in the material itself, rather than in surface formation. O K-edge spectra in TEY mode were also taken of possible surface species (Li 2 O, Li 2O2, Li2CO3) and can be found in the Supporting Information, along with the results for the pristine sample.

Transition-metal L-edge XANES spectroscopy directly probes the electron dipole transition from the 2p core level to the 3d valence states. Thus, these spectra are sensitive to factors that change 3d orbital splitting and occupation, such as spin con /uniFB01 guration, ligand /uniFB01 eld, and valence state. 32 Mn LII,III -edge XANES spectra are shown in Figure 7, where the pristine state for each value of x was found to correspond to a 4+ valence state based on the line shape and energy positions. For Li 2 MnO3, upon charging to 4.8 V, the pre-edge starts to slightly

shift toward a lower energy, which indicates a slight change in valence state to a value less than 4+.

The reduction trend of Mn in Li2MnO3 is similar to that of Li2Ru1 -y Mn y O3, as evidenced by X-ray photoemission spectroscopy. 33 Upon discharging, the LIII -edge line shape changes to resemble that of the LiMn2O4 spinel structure, and the L II -edge shifts toward lower energy, indicating a decrease in the valence below 4+. For Li 1.2 Ni0.2 Mn0.6O2, a trend similar to that of Li 2 MnO3 was found that also corresponds well with previous studies, 9,33 with the exception of that by Fell et al., 34 who used electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) to observe a return to the 4+ valence state for Mn after one cycle of discharge. This discrepancy might be related to the energy resolution and/or the local range in using EELS. The changes in the L III -edge line shape in Li 1.2 Ni0.2Mn0.6O2 are not as dramatic as those of Li2MnO3, and the shifts in the LII-edge are only slight. For LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2, no obvious changes were observed in the Mn LII,III-edge XANES spectra, which agrees well with a previous study. 22 To show that Mn does indeed participate in the charge-compensation mechanism after oxygen activation, spectra at the /uniFB01 fth cycle were recorded for Li2MnO3. Figure 7d shows the Mn LII,III-edge XANES spectra recorded for the /uniFB01 fth cycle at the discharged and fully charged states for Li 2 MnO3. It can be seen that the lower-energy position at the discharged state shifted to a higher energy that corresponds to a 4+ valence state and the shape of the L III -edge closely resembles that of the pristine state. To con /uniFB01 rm that these changes were prominent throughout the entire lithium-rich tie line, Mn L II,III -edge XANES spectra were recorded for LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2 after di /uniFB00 erent numbers of cycles. Figure 7e shows Mn LII,III -edge XANES spectra for LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2 for the pristine and 10thcycle-discharged states, where the pre-edge has slightly shifted toward lower energy and the line shape is starting to show some distortion similar to that of Li 2MnO3 and Li 1.2 Ni0.2Mn0.6O2. In a study of Mn K-edge XANES and extended X-ray absorption /uniFB01 ne structure (EXAFS) spectra of

Li 2 MnO3, Rana et al. 16 observed no changes in the Mn valence state after cycling, in contrast to the current work. This discrepancy might be related to the di /uniFB00 erence in electron dipole transitions between probing K- and L-edges, where the K-edge is a quadruple transition from 1s to 3d whereas the L-edge is a transition from 2p to 3d. Figure 7f shows Mn LII,III -edge XANES spectra for LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2 and Li1.2 Ni0.2Mn0.6O2 after extended cycling to 155 cycles, where LiNi 0.5Mn0.5O2 exhibited only a slight shift to the pre-edge and slight changes in line shape whereas Li 1.2 Ni0.2Mn0.6O2 exhibited a shift in the L II-edge and distortion of the line shape similar to that of Li2MnO3 after the /uniFB01 fth cycle. The Mn LII,III-edge XANES spectrum was also taken in FY mode but showed distortions in the form of inversions that might be related to the concentration of Mn and the thickness of the electrode. The inversion is related to the /uniFB02 uorescence decay, probably resulting from the fact that the ionization of the Mn L II,III -shell is 10 times smaller than that of the O K-shell, which leads to a dip pro /uniFB01 le. 35 An example is presented in the Supporting Information.

Ni LII,III-edge XANES spectra in FY mode are shown in Figure 8 for LiNi 0.5Mn0.5O2 and Li1.2 Ni0.2Mn0.6O2 in di /uniFB00 erent voltage states. In both cases, up to 4.4 V, both edges shifted toward higher energy, indicating the Ni 2+ to 4+ redox pair. At 4.8 V, whereas LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2 remained relatively unchanged from 4.4 to 4.8 V, Li 1.2 Ni0.2Mn0.6O2 exhibited a shift toward lower energy at 4.8 V, indicating a change to a valence state lower than 4+. Upon discharge, both materials returned to the formal 2+ valence state.

To con /uniFB01 rm the redox behavior of Ni in Li 1.2 Ni0.2Mn0.6O2, Ni and Mn K-edge XANES spectra were also obtained for di /uniFB00 erent voltage stages, as shown in Figure 9.

When the amterials were charged to 4.4 and 4.6 V, the energy position of the rising line shifted past that of LiNiO2 (3+). At 4.8 V, a shift toward lower energy can be seen, where the position suggests a reduced valence state slightly higher than 3+. The implication of this reduction after the oxygen-

activation plateau is discussed in the next section. For the Mn K-edge XANES spectrum, the line shape changed upon charging to 4.8 V, suggesting a rearrangement of transitionmetal ions that might have distorted the local environment around Mn. No energy shift was observed upon discharge to 2.5 V, which is similar to the results of previous studies on Li2MnO3. 16 The results for the Mn K-edge and Ni K- and L II,III -edge XANES spectra agree well with previous studies on similar materials. 28,36,37

## ■ DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

For the LiNi 0.5Mn0.5O2 end member on the lithium-rich layered line, the charge-compensation mechanism follows a solid-state redox reaction, which occurs in a topotactic manner. 2 Speci /uniFB01 cally, the Ni valence state moves from 2+ to 4+ with lithium extraction and returns to 2+ when lithium is reinserted. The Mn valence state remains in the 4+ state throughout lithium extraction and insertion. At the other end of the line, there are two proposed mechanisms to describe the chargecompensation mechanism for Li2MnO3, which was once believed to be inactive. The mechanisms are (1) oxygen activation, in which both lithium and oxygen are extracted, leading to the O 2 -/ -anionic redox chemistry, and (2) Li + -H + exchange. Evidence for both mechanisms have been observed, which might suggest competing or complementary occurrences of the two mechanisms. 18,33,38 For clarity, we focus our discussion on the assumption that the anionic redox pair is the dominating mechanism between the two. The behavior and participation of Mn, if any, during electrochemical charging and discharging still remains a matter of debate. Theoretically, the Mn valence state could move from 4+ to 5+ during charging to reach the experimentally obtained capacities. 2 However, to the best of our knowledge, no clear evidence of Mn in the 5+ valence state has been reported. Recently, Kubobichi et al. 17 used ab initio multiplet calculations and XAS to show that it is not suitable for a Mn 5+ valence state to be present in the Li 2 MnO 3 end member. Sathiya et al. 33 showed that the valence state of Mn will reduce from 4+ to ∼ 3.7+ in Li2Ru1 -y Sn y O3, and they attributed this reduction to the modi /uniFB01 cation of the coordination sphere of the transition metal to the peroxo-/ superoxo-like species that is formed during the oxygenactivation plateau. They further con /uniFB01 rmed this result in the Li2Ru1 -y Sn y O3 material by using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and density function theory calculations to show that the single participating Ru ion can form these speci /uniFB01 c hybridizations with the di /uniFB00 erent ligand peroxo-/superoxo-like species. 3 The present Mn LII,III-edge XANES data further con /uniFB01 rm these results, where the Mn 4+ valence state will fall to a value closer to the 3.5+ valence state in the discharged state based on the energy position when the oxygen-activation mechanism is involved and the Mn redox couple subsequently participates in the charge-compensation mechanism after the /uniFB01 rst cycle. As can be seen in Li2MnO3, the involvement of Mn in the hybridization of the peroxo-/ superoxo-like species causes changes in orbital intermixing that are related to the bond length. 16 Changes in intermixing shift the energies of these orbitals, causing the Mn LIII -edge initial orbital splitting (e g and t 2g ) to be distorted with further splitting. Changes in the crystal/uniFB01 eld splitting are directly related to the coordination of Mn with the oxygen atoms, where the line shape of the discharged Li2MnO3 suggests a coordination similar to that in cubic Mn2O3 (3+). 32 The detrimental changes in the Mn and oxygen interaction are more pronounced for the surface 3d/4sp band intensity ratio of the O K-edge XANES spectra, where the initial surface hybridization decreases to almost 50% compared to that in the pristine state. The interaction between transition-metal ions

and oxygen ligands through hybridization has considerable implications for electrochemical energy storage, such as increased hybridization of water-splitting catalyst related to improved activity. 27 This might suggest that these changes are related to the transformation of the initial layered structure into a more spinel-like structure. 39 Therefore, it is suggested that maintaining Mn primarily as a spectator metal rather than a participant in the charging mechanism after the /uniFB01 rst cycle is crucial in maintaining structural integrity. Moving across the lithium-rich layered line, Li 1.2 Ni0.2Mn0.6O2, /uniFB01 rst goes through the solid-state topotactic redox reaction, which is then followed by the oxygen-activation mechanism at higher voltages. The oxygen-activation plateau generally leads to a loss of ordering within the transition-metal plane, as evidenced by the loss of the superstructure peaks at higher voltages. Upon deeper examination, the participation of Ni goes beyond the conventional solid-state redox chemistry. Although the Ni 2+/4+ redox pair initially follows the conventional solid-state redox reaction up to 4.4 V, when the oxygen-activation plateau is reached at ∼ 4.5 V, Ni 4+ begins to e /uniFB00 ectively decrease in valence state less than 4+ but higher than 3+, as evidenced by the Ni K- and LII,III-edge XANES spectra. This is believed to result from the substitution of Mn by Ni and its hybridization with the peroxo-/superoxo-like species. It should be noted that this hybridization is with activated oxygen species and not the diminished initial hybridization observed on the surface. Recently, for the lithium-rich material Li 2 -x Ru 0.5Mn0.5O3, Sathiya et al. 3,33 described the preferential hybridization of Ru over Mn with activated oxygen species, providing a qualitative representation of the density of states of the electronic band structure in which the less electropositive character of Ru compared to Mn results in a stronger metal-to-ligand hybridization. The hybridization of Ru with the activated oxygen species occurs by the oxidized Ru 5+ being pushed to a virtual state of Ru 6+ or Ru 5+ and a hole being formed on the O 2 -band. They further described the formation of oxygen vacancies as most likely being triggered by the destabilization of the oxidized O -2p levels. Similarly to Ru-based lithium-rich materials, this hybridization can be further extended to Ni- and Mn-based lithium-rich materials, where the metal ( n d) -ligand (sp) hybridization is commonly seen as a function of the electropositive character or electronegativity and, because of strong electron repulsion, the oxidation state, given that the n d orbitals of the transition metal generally decrease in energy as the metal oxidation state increases. Hence, a more electronegative and highly oxidized transition metal is preferable hybridized to the ligand, which, in this case, is the activated oxygen species. In contrast to the Ru- and Mn-based material, Ni and Mn are both 3d metals and lie close to each other in the periodic table, but Ni has a larger electronegativity and, during the activation of oxygen, Ni is already at a 4+ oxidation state, giving it preference to hybridize with the activated oxygen species over Mn. Thus, Ni hybridizes with the activated oxygen species and subsequently reduces due to the change in coordination mode. 3 However, because of similar characteristics, once Ni begins to reduce at the oxygen-activation plateau, the reduced Ni oxidation state allows for some Mn 4+ to be hybridized with activated oxygen species, thereby reducing Mn slightly, as seen in the XAS data. This Ni valence-state reduction was also observed f or the equivalent Li 1.11 Ni0.33Mn0.56O2 ( x = 1 /3 ) composition, as well as in Li 1.16 Ni0.15 Co0.19 Mn 0.5 O2 in both soft and hard XAS looking at the surface and the bulk. 28,37 This hybridization leads to electronic structural changes, but to a lesser extent than for Li2MnO3, as evidenced by the Mn K-edge pre-edge and Mn LII,III-edge XANES line shapes and energy shifts. These line shapes and energy shifts resemble those in the LiMn2O4Mn LII,III-edge XANES spectrum. 9 The 3d/4sp band intensity ratio of the O K-edge XANES spectrum shows that there is still a considerable decrease in hybridization between the transition metal and oxygen ligand (loss of ∼ 25%). However, the loss is not as severe as in the Li2MnO3 member, providing evidence for an improved stability due to the involvement of Ni in the oxygen-activation mechanism by avoiding the direct peroxo-/ superoxo-like species with Mn that leads to dramatic electronic structural changes. It is still not clear what speci /uniFB01 c amount of Ni, if any, would be the optimal amount necessary to maintain structural integrity and stability, as one must consider the Li2MnO3 component within the lithium-rich material, where instability arises because of activation of this component, leading to the two mechanisms of hystersis and voltage fade. 4,7 Hence, increased Ni content also means decreased Li2MnO3 content, where, at this time, the contributions from the two cannot be completely separated. In any case, regardless of the speci /uniFB01 c amount of Ni, this study shows that the interaction occurring between Ni and O when oxygen activation occurs directly a /uniFB00 ects the participation of Mn and is not simply a mixture between the two materials Li2MnO3 and LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2. Hard XAS measurements hint that ordering within the transition-metal plane between Ni, Mn, and Li also plays a role in structural changes (see Figures S3 and S4, Supporting Information). It should also be noted that, unlike the decrease in hybridization occurring primarily within the surface as evidenced by the O K-edge in TEY mode, the reduction of Ni occurs across the bulk to local domains, as shown by the Ni LII,III-edge XANES spectrum in FY mode and the Ni K-edge XANES spectrum in transmission mode. Previous results also showed that this phenomenon occurs within the surface as well, which was evidenced in TEY mode. 9,28 It is believed that the reduction of Ni due to hybridization with activated oxygen species occurs throughout the material whereas the decrease in hybridization generally occurs within the surface domain. The decrease in hybridization is believed to be the direct result of oxygen vacancy formation that occurs mostly at the surface, possibly as a result slow oxygen migration during oxygen activation. 40 As reported by Qian et al., 40 the transition metal ions in the oxygen-vacancyrich regions are subjected to /uniFB01 ve O-coordination or broken transition-metal-to-ligand bonds on the particle surface, which subsequently leads to the formation of spinel-like phases on the surface. Incorporation of another transition metal has been shown to slightly relieve these electronic structural changes. 28 However, this only serves to delay the eventual changes. 39 In contrast, for the LiNi0.5Mn0.5O 2 end member, the transformation is present only slightly at the 10th cycle and only slightly more at the 155th cycle, as evidenced by the Mn L II,III -edge XANES line shape and the lack of a dramatic decrease in hybridization. However, it should be mentioned that LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2 does not go through a dramatic oxygenactivation process where increased Ni shortens the oxygenactivation plateau. It is still not clear whether these changes are completely related to surface-electrolyte interphase interaction or hybridization-induced changes. Lin et al. 20 showed that a surface reconstruction would occur for stoichiometric layered cathode materials under high-voltage cycling. Therefore, surface-electrolyte interactions also contribute, to a certain

degree, to changes in the surface of the material. Further studies need to be done on di /uniFB00 erent pragmatic cometals that might e /uniFB00 ectively stabilize Mn or speci /uniFB01 c compositions that might improve stability at the cost of speci /uniFB01 c capacity.

To summarize, this work clari /uniFB01 es and provides evidence for the participation of Mn in the charge-compensation mechanism occurring in Li[Ni x Li (1 -2 x )/3Mn(2 -x )/3]O2 materials after the /uniFB01 rst cycle. More importantly, we have shown the role of Ni in stabilizing nickel -manganese-containing lithium-rich cathode materials by going beyond the classical solid-state redox-pair reaction and preferentially hybridizing with the activated oxygen species and subsequently reducing. This preferential hybridization is related to electronegativity and oxidation state in which Ni has a higher electronegativity than Mn and a similar oxidation state at the oxygen-activation plateau. This preferential hybridization avoids the decrease in structurally supporting Mn 4+ to an unstable 3+ state that subsequently leads to structural transformations. However, the relatively similar characteristics between Mn and Ni still allow for some Mn to be hybridized once Ni is reduced. In addition, it was observed that a decrease of the d -p hybridization within the surface has a strong correlation with instability, which is speculated to be a direct result of the formation of oxygen vacancies on the surface of the material. Optimization in maintaining or increasing d -p hybridization during the oxygenactivation plateau might involve the incorporation of di /uniFB00 erent cometals, variation of the composition at the cost of speci /uniFB01 c capacity, or increased distribution of the transition-metal ions.

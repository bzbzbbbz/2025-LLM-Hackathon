ABSTRACT: Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy investigations have been carried out to follow changes in the atomic and electronic local structures of all three transition metals for the Li 1.20 Mn0.54 Co0.13 Ni0.13O2 layered oxide during the /uniFB01 rst and second charges and discharges of lithium batteries. The experiments were performed using a Quick-XAS monochromator on the SAMBA beamline at Synchrotron SOLEIL to record the three K-edges by edge-jumping between two energy ranges ([Mn, Co] and [Co, Ni]) every 3 min during the cycling of the battery. The results obtained especially at the Mn K-edge fully support the participation of oxygen in the reversible charge -discharge reaction of this Li- and Mn-rich layered material as a redox center and not only with oxygen loss, as was proposed previously.

## I. INTRODUCTION

Lithium ion batteries have been used for portable devices for 2 decades, and they are favorite candidates as power sources for future vehicles, such as hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and electric vehicles. LiCoO2 has been widely used in lithium ion batteries as positive electrode; 1 however, it is di /uniFB03 cult to maintain LiCoO2 in the batteries developed for vehicles due to its high price as a rare resource of Co, as well as due to safety concerns in the charged state. Recently, polyanionic materials exempli /uniFB01 ed by LiFePO4 were proposed as new positive electrodes for lithium ion batteries for transportation applications. 2 LiFePO4 was found to be very attractive because iron as well as phosphate are abundant and thus low-priced raw materials; furthermore, it shows a very high thermal stability in the charged state of the battery with (for optimized material) very good reversibility even at high rates. Nevertheless, polyanionic materials have disadvantages as compared to LiCoO2, such as low electronic and ionic conductivities and low energy density 3 The (1 -x )LiMO2 · x Li2MnO3 (M = Ni, Co, Mn) system was reported as one of those delivering the largest capacity among layered oxides. 4 -6 Indeed, the charge and discharge mechanism was found to be di /uniFB00 erent, with an irreversible ' plateau ' around 4.5 V vs Li + /Li during the /uniFB01 rst charge. It was thought to be at the origin of the overcapacity observed for that kind of Li- and Mn-rich system. During the plateau, Dahn and co-workers mentioned that oxide ions are oxidized and then lost from the structure, 4,7 -9 but the detailed mechanism is in fact still under debate.

We have shown in our group that irreversible structural reorganization occurs upon cycling of the lithiumand manganese-rich layered oxide Li 1.20 Mn0.54Co0.13 Ni0.13O2 in lithium cells. 10 A mixture of two phases is formed on the high voltage plateau and is then preserved upon long-range cycling. The impact of the particles ' size and cycling conditions (cycling rate, temperature, and number of cycles) on the distribution between the two phases shows that the surface and the bulk react di /uniFB00 erently. In both cases, oxygen participates in the reactions involved upon cycling of Li 1.20 Mn0.54 Co0.13 Ni0.13O2: for one phase, rather present in the bulk, through (reversible) oxygen oxidation and for the other phase, rather present at the surface, through oxidation of oxygen anion with departure of O2. In the latter, oxygen loss induces migration of the transition metal ions to the lithium vacancies from the surface to the bulk and a densi /uniFB01 cation of the host structure. Chemical and redox titrations, magnetic measurements, and analysis of neutron di /uniFB00 raction data led us to propose an average chemical formula of Li 1.11 Mn0.58Co0.14 Ni0.14O2 in the reduced state, with manganese ions mainly at the tetravalent state and the oxygen content close to that in the pristine material. 11 We have shown that during the /uniFB01 rst charge about 0.40 electrons are exchanged on oxygen anions per formula unit. During the cell discharge and the following cycles, Ni and Co are involved in the redox processes in the entire particle (from the surface to the bulk)

while oxygen is electrochemically active only in the part of the particle where there are a signi /uniFB01 cant number of lithium vacancies in interaction with MnO6 octahedra. In the other part, more at the surface, Mn participates in the redox processes.

We report here XAS measurements to get more insight into changes occurring in Li 1.20 Mn0.54 Co0.13 Ni0.13 O2, to the oxidation state of each transition metal ion, and also to their local environment during the charge and discharge. XAS measurements were performed operando with an in situ cell developed to prevent any degradation of the materials during their characterization but also to be closer to the materials really observed during operation of the battery. 12

## II. EXPERIMENTAL SECTION

Li 1.20 Mn0.54 Co0.13 Ni0.13O2 was prepared using the sol -gel method, as described in detail in ref 13. The positive electrodes for ex situ XAS measurement consisted of 75 wt % of active material, 20 wt % of a carbon black/graphite (1:1) mixture, and 5 wt % of polytetra /uniFB02 uoroethylene (PTFE). They were cut into 14 mm diameter disks containing 11 mg/cm 2 of active material and pressed at 40 MPa on an Al foil. Coin cells were assembled in an argon/uniFB01 lled glovebox with Li metal as the counter electrode and 1 M LiPF6 dissolved in a mixture of propylene carbonate (PC), ethylene carbonate (EC), and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) 1:1:3 by volume as the electrolyte. After cycling, positive electrodes were recovered from coin cells at di /uniFB00 erent states of charge and discharge in order to compare their XAS spectra to those obtained operando during the cycling of the batteries (as described below). Prior to these ex situ experiments, the electrodes were rinsed in an excess of DMC in order to remove the residual electrolyte salt (LiPF 6 ) and then dried under vacuum. The positive electrodes for operando XAS measurement were prepared with same processes as for ex situ XAS measurement, except that a 0.024 mm thick Al foil was used as current collector. The cell for operando XAS experiments was prepared in an argon/uniFB01 lled glovebox with the same counter electrode and electrolyte as those used for classical batteries, the speci /uniFB01 city of the electrochemical cell developed for these kinds of experiments in transmission mode is the presence of two beryllium windows that allow X-rays passing through the overall stacking. 12 The electrochemical measurements were performed between 2.5 and 4.8 V vs Li + /Li at C/10 cycling rate (1 C rate corresponding to the theoretical exchange of one electron in 1 h). We have taken advantage of the Quick-XAS monochromator 14 on the SAMBA beamline (Synchrotron SOLEIL), to record the three K-edges by edge-jumping between two energy ranges, namely [Mn, Co] and [Co, Ni], every 3 min during operation of the cell (Figure 1). The Co Kedge was thus recorded twice, allowing us to check continuously that no signi /uniFB01 cant changes occur within 3 min that correspond to the exchange of ∼ 0.00167 e -. The storage ring was operated in multibunch top-up at 2.75 GeV with a 400 mA current. The incident beam from the bending magnet was collimated by a /uniFB01 rst cylindrically bendable silicon Pd coated mirror and then was monochromatized using the channel-cut Si(111) QuickExafs monochromator, 14 and the harmonic rejection was done thanks to the set of Pd-coated /uniFB01 rst and second mirrors tilted at 6 mrad. The beam size (7 mm × 0.6 mm, horizontal × vertical) and the position on the sample were kept constant during the acquisition except (for one or two chosen samples) when the cell was moved to check the

homogeneity within the electrode. The spectra were collected at the three K-edges (Mn, Co, and Ni) in transmission mode utilizing gas ionization chambers as detectors. As we have three detectors in series, we can measure during all the experiments a Co metal foil that can be used as reference to calibrate the energy. The measurement was carried out at 1 Hz with an amplitude of 3.9 ° around the Bragg angle. Analysis of X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption /uniFB01 ne structure (EXAFS) data was performed with the Athena and Artemis software packages. 15

## III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

1. Electrochemical Performance of the Cell Developed for Operando Study Using Synchrotron Radiation. XAS measurements with the cell developed for operando study of processes occurring in batteries during their charges and discharges have the advantage that unstable states of a positive electrode at high voltage can be measured in situ, without any additional sample preparation or manipulation. The electrochemical curves obtained for a Li//Li 1.20 Mn0.54 Co0.13 Ni0.13O2 battery using either a coin cell or the cell developed for these operando synchrotron studies are compared in Figure 2 to check reproducibility between these experiments. The charge and discharge curves obtained for the in situ cell do appear very similar to those obtained classically for a coin cell (although with a slightly larger polarization), showing that this setup can be used to get more insight into the redox and structural changes occurring in Li 1.20 Mn0.54 Co0.13 Ni0.13O2 upon cycling. To check the homogeneity of the electrochemical reaction within the electrode, XAS measurements were performed at di /uniFB00 erent locations of the electrode, at the end of the relaxation process following the end of discharge, for instance. The spectra obtained were found to be identical, showing that, at a C/10 rate, the electrochemical reaction occurs homogeneously within the electrode in this cell running during the operando XAS study.

2. XANES Study during the Charge and Discharge of Li//Li 1.20 Mn0.54Co0.13Ni0.13O2 Batteries. Operando XAS measurements were performed during the /uniFB01 rst and second cycles to get more insight into the irreversible reaction occurring during the /uniFB01 rst cycle. In addition, the /uniFB01 rst cycle was performed in di /uniFB00 erent potential windows, the charge being either stopped just before the plateau observed at high voltage around 4.5 V vs Li + /Li or at 4.8 V (i.e., after the plateau). XANES spectra obtained at the Ni, Co, and Mn K-edges during the /uniFB01 rst cycle including the plateau, the /uniFB01 rst cycle excluding the plateau, and the second cycle (including the plateau) are shown in Figures 3 -8. Representative XANES spectra are given for each transition metal K-edge for various compositions, as

indicated by arrows during the charge and discharge. XANES spectra were recorded in 500 ms (two spectra at 1 Hz) and the spectra reported here are in fact the sums of 100 single spectra. 2.1. Ni K-Edge. XANES spectra obtained at the Ni K-edge for LiNi II 1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 and LiNi III 0.80 Co0.15 Al0.05 O2 are given as dotted lines in Figures 3 and 4, as references for the various oxidation states of Ni in a layered oxide structure. The oxidation state of Ni in the pristine material was determined as Ni 2+ , as its spectrum is similar to that of LiNi II 1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 (Figure 3a). During the charge before the plateau, XANES spectra recorded at the Ni K-edge clearly shift continuously to higher energies by 3.1 eV, to a higher value than that observed for LiNi III 0.80 Co0.15 Al0.05O2, as highlighted by the arrow in Figure 3a. This shift of the Ni K-edge and comparison with results already reported for Li x NiO2 indicate that Ni 2+ ions are oxidized to the Ni 4+ oxidation state during the charge before the plateau. 16 -19 When the lithium cell is then discharged (before the plateau) Ni K-edge XANES spectra shift reversibly to lower energy, reaching the same position as that observed for the pristine material (not reported here). This shows that Ni ions are reduced back to the Ni 2+ oxidation state during discharge. During the charge through the plateau, Ni K-edge XANES spectra almost do not shift (i.e., by less than 0.2 eV), and only a very small change in their shape is observed: the maximum of the absorption edge moves in one direction, whereas the edge moves in the other (Figure 3b). As expected, no oxidation of Ni ions is observed, but local structural changes probably occur. For instance, as already reported by Yabuuchi et al., partial migration of nickel ions from the octahedral sites of the slab to the octahedral sites of the interslab space can already markedly modify the Ni K-edge spectra. 20 Note that, contrary to the results recently reported by Oishi et al. for a material with similar composition (stated to be Li 1.16 Ni0.15Co0.19Mn0.50O2), we did not observe any reduction

of Ni ions upon charging on the plateau. 21 During the discharge after the plateau, Ni K-edge XANES spectra shift continuously to lower energies by 3.4 eV, down to the position observed initially for the pristine material (Figure 3c).

This reveals that Ni ions are reduced back to the Ni 2+ oxidation state during discharge. During the second cycle performed after a /uniFB01 rst cycle in the potential window 2.5 -4.8 V vs Li + /Li, Ni K-edge XANES spectra show, as commonly observed for other layered oxides, the oxidation of Ni ions to the Ni 4+ oxidation state during the charge and their reversible reduction to the Ni 2+ oxidation state during the discharge (Figure 4a,b).

2.2. Co K-Edge. LiNi1/3 Co III 1/3Mn1/3O2 and Co II,III 3O4 were measured as references for various oxidation states for Co ions. The Co K-edge XANES spectrum for the pristine material is close to that observed for the layered oxide LiNi1/3 Co III 1/3 Mn1/3O2, as shown in Figure 5a, showing that the oxidation state of Co ions in the pristine material is Co 3+ . During the charge before the plateau, the half-height energy of the XANES spectra does not shift signi /uniFB01 cantly, as shown in Figure 5a. However, their shapes change continuously, and especially, the position of the maximum of absorption shifts to higher energies ( Δ E ∼ 2.4 eV). As reported for LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 and LiCoO2 in refs 19, and 23, respectively, such subtle changes reveal that Co 3+ ions are

oxidized to Co 4+ during the /uniFB01 rst charge before the plateau. Then, during the discharge before the plateau, the Co K-edge XANES spectra change continuously and reversibly back to one similar to that of the pristine material, showing that Co ions are reduced back to the Co 3+ oxidation state (not reported here).

During the plateau, only slight modi /uniFB01 cations are observed in the Co K-edge XANES spectra (Figure 5b), showing that, as expected, Co ions are not oxidized further during the plateau. Again, we also did not observe any reduction of cobalt on the plateau, as Oishi et al. did, 21 but only the maximum of the absorption edge that moves to slightly higher energies, whereas the edge itself moves to slightly lower energies. As shown in Figure 5c, during the /uniFB01 rst discharge after the plateau the Co Kedge XANES spectra shift to lower energies, showing that Co ions are reduced to Co 3+ as in the pristine material. During the second cycle performed after a /uniFB01 rst cycle in the potential window 2.5 -4.8 V vs Li + /Li, the XANES spectra continuously shift to higher energies during the charge and to lower energies during the discharge, as shown in Figure 6a -b, in good agreement with the reversible oxidation and reduction of Co ions as commonly observed in layered oxides.

2.3. Mn K-Edge. LiNi1/3 Co1/3Mn IV 1/3 O2, LiMn III,IV 2O4, and Li 2 Mn IV O3 were measured as references for various oxidation states of Mn ions; the comparison of their XANES spectra with that of the pristine material in Figure 7a supports the presence of Mn 4+ in Li 1.20 Mn0.54 Co0.13 Ni0.13O2 as in Li 2 Mn IV O3. Whatever the state of charge or of discharge during the /uniFB01 rst cycle, the Mn K-edge XANES spectra do not change signi /uniFB01 cantly; the maximum of the absorption edge shifts in one direction, by 1.2 eV only, whereas the edge moves in the other direction, suggesting that Mn ions do not participate in the redox processes (Figures 7a -c and 8a).

This observation is very similar to that observed at the Mn Kedge for LiNi 1/3Co1/3Mn IV 1/3 O2 that showed no participation of Mn in the redox processes. 22 It is interesting to mention also

Figure 5. Normalized representative XANES spectra at the Co K-edge for Li 1.20 Mn0.54 Co0.13 Ni0.13O2 during the /uniFB01 rst charge before the plateau (a), the /uniFB01 rst charge during the plateau up to 4.8 V vs Li + /Li (b), and the /uniFB01 rst discharge after the plateau (c). The spectra for LiNi1/3 Co III 1/3Mn1/3O2 and Co II,III 3 O4 are given as references.

that Mn K-edge XANES spectra were reported to shift signi /uniFB01 cantly upon cycling for other Mn-rich materials showing changes in Mn oxidation state; in addition, signi /uniFB01 cant changes were also observed in the shape of their edges depending on the presence (or not) of Jahn -Teller distorted Mn 3+ ions. 24,25

Note that the changes observed at the Mn K-edge during the second cycle are very similar to those observed during the /uniFB01 rst cycle, i.e., no obvious shift in energy but only a continuous modi /uniFB01 cation of the shape (Figure 8b -c). Such small changes are expected despite nonparticipation of Mn in the redox processes, since oxidation of Ni to the Ni 4+ state induces an increase in the covalency of the Ni -O bonds and consequently changes in the distribution of the electrons between Mn and O in antagonistic bonds. The pre-edge of Mn K-edge XANES spectra is also expected to be very sensitive to changes in the oxidation state of Mn ions, 26 with the peak at lower energy corresponding to the transitions from 1s to 3d eg states and that at higher energy to the transitions from 1s to 3d t2g states. In our experiments, the pre-edge of XANES spectra recorded at the Mn K-edge during the /uniFB01 rst cycle does not shift continuously, as shown in Figure 9, con /uniFB01 rming that the manganese oxidation state does not change. The continuous change in intensity of the global pre-edge during charge and discharge (Figure 9) reveals that the distortion of the octahedral sites increases during the /uniFB01 rst charge and decreases during the next discharge, 27 but without recovering that of the pristine material.

Figure 6. Normalized representative XANES spectra at the Co K-edge for Li 1.20 Mn0.54 Co0.13 Ni0.13O2 during the second charge (a) and the second discharge (b), after a /uniFB01 rst cycle in the potential window 2.5 -4.8 V. The spectra for LiNi 1/3 Co III 1/3Mn1/3O2 and Co II,III 3 O4 are given as references.

This is a further reason to conclude that Mn ions were not oxidized over the tetravalent state. In the case of the formation of supervalent Mn ions (i.e., Mn x + with x &gt; 4), signi /uniFB01 cant changes of intensity should be observed for the pre-edge due to their migration from octahedral sites to tetrahedral sites for their stabilization. 28

As shown in Figure 10, no di /uniFB00 erence is observed between the spectra obtained ex situ or operando, whatever the metal Kedge. Such reproducibility between operando and ex situ experiments is not surprising, as the studies were performed operando at C/10, which is a rather slow rate. As already alluded to, the Ni K-edge spectra recorded for the pristine material and the material obtained after the /uniFB01 rst cycle including the plateau are very similar in position and in shape, whereas the Co and Mn spectra are di /uniFB00 erent in shape for the same materials. This di /uniFB00 erence between Ni and (Co, Mn) is expected considering the cation ordering observed in the slabs. 13 Ni is surrounded by oxygen as /uniFB01 rst neighbors and then by Co and Mn as second neighbors. Its local environment in the slabs thus appears not to change signi /uniFB01 cantly between the beginning and the end of the /uniFB01 rst cycle. On the contrary, Mn and Co are surrounded by oxygen as /uniFB01 rst neighbors and by [2Li, 1Ni, 3(Co, Mn)] as second neighbors; the di /uniFB00 erence in the Co and Mn spectra between the beginning and the end of the /uniFB01 rst cycle thus suggests that an irreversible modi /uniFB01 cation occurs at the local scale, which could be attributed /uniFB01 rst to irreversible lithium deintercalation from the slabs but also to cation reorganization within the lithium vacancies created. 11

A comparison of these XANES spectra at the Ni, Co, and Mn K-edges with those obtained after the 10th cycle is also given in Figure 10. All of these spectra are found to be very similar to those obtained for the material after the /uniFB01 rst cycle, showing that the oxidation state and environment of each transition metal ion does not change signi /uniFB01 cantly between the /uniFB01 rst and the 10th cycles. In parallel, an irreversible plateau is observed only in the

/uniFB01 rst charge, and the following charge and discharge curves continuously change upon cycling. 10 From the XANES analysis only we cannot therefore state that this change be caused by a change in the redox processes. In order to get more insight into changes in the local structure, EXAFS spectra were analyzed in detail in the following at the Ni, Co, and Mn K-edges.

3. Analysis of the EXAFS Spectra Recorded Operando upon Cycling. The metal -oxygen and metal -metal distances can be estimated from EXAFS spectra to follow changes in the oxidation state of each transition metal and in their local environment during the charge and discharge. A /uniFB01 t of the EXAFS data was performed using Artemis software. Better /uniFB01 tting results could be obtained by considering the description of the structure in the C 2/ m space group, i.e., with a cation local ordering as in Li2MnO3: Ni ions are surrounded by six transition metals, whereas Co and Mn ions are surrounded by four transition metals and two Li + ions (see the Supporting Information, Figure S1). For comparison, a description of the structure considering the R 3 ̅ m space group as for LiNiO 2 would lead to all transition metal ions being surrounded by 4.8 transition metal ions (as 0.2Li and 0.8M are present in the slabs). This result is another con /uniFB01 rmation of the cation local ordering and is in good agreement with the results previously obtained by electron di /uniFB00 raction, 7 Li MAS NMR, and Raman spectroscopy. 13

k 3 -Weighted Fourier transforms of EXAFS spectra recorded at the Ni, Co, and Mn K-edges are compared in Figure S2 (Supporting Information) for the pristine material, the material obtained in charge just before the plateau, the material obtained after a charge before the plateau followed by a /uniFB01 rst discharge, the material obtained after a full charge up to 4.8 V vs Li + /Li, and, /uniFB01 nally, the material after the /uniFB01 rst full cycle. Changes in the intensity and position, especially for the /uniFB01 rst peak, which is related to the M -O distance, are observed during the /uniFB01 rst cycle. These changes are considered by some authors to be caused by oxygen loss during the /uniFB01 rst charge of Li-rich layered oxides. 26 However, similar changes in intensity were observed by other authors in normal (non overlithiated) layered oxides 17 -19 and in materials with other structures. 24 Furthermore, according to our results, the intensity of the /uniFB01 rst peak in EXAFS data decreases already during the charge before the plateau, i.e., at a step at which oxygen loss is not expected to happen. In our opinion, the change in the peak intensity is thus not directly linked to oxygen loss (which would indeed lead to a decrease in the number of oxygen neighbors) but most probably to a larger disorder (i.e., distribution of distances) as suggested by a larger Debye -Waller factor (see Table S1 in the Supporting Information).

We have, however, also considered possible changes in the number of oxygen neighbors around each transition metal ion;

Figure 9. Pre-edge of normalized XANES spectra at the Mn K-edge of Li 1.20 Mn0.54 Co0.13 Ni0.13O2 during the /uniFB01 rst charge before the plateau (a), during the plateau up to 4.8 V vs Li + /Li (b), the /uniFB01 rst discharge after the plateau (c), and the /uniFB01 rst discharge before the plateau (d).

indeed, according to the mechanism of oxygen loss proposed to explain the plateau, one oxygen /uniFB01 rst neighbor out of six would be lost. No signi /uniFB01 cant change from six was in fact observed in our case, even taking into account the possibly strong correlation between the Debye -Waller factor and the number of neighbors deduced from the /uniFB01 t. This result supports again that almost no oxygen is lost during the plateau. 10,11

Metal -/uniFB01 rst oxygen neighbor distances and metal -/uniFB01 rst metal neighbor distances obtained from the re /uniFB01 nement of k 3 -weighted Fourier transforms of EXAFS spectra are given in Figures 11 -13, and the absolute error on each distance is ± 0.01. During the /uniFB01 rst cycle, changes observed in the Ni -O distances including or not the plateau are compared in Figure 11a to those of Ni II -O and Ni III -O distances in the LiNi II 1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 and LiNi III 0.80 Co0.15 Al0.05O2 references, respectively. The Ni -O distance decreases during the charge before the plateau to values smaller than that observed for LiNi III 0.80 Co0.15 Al0.05O2. This is in good agreement with a decreasing ionic radius for the Ni ions and their oxidation to Ni IV upon Li deintercalation. Then, in discharge after a charge

just before the plateau, the Ni -O distance increases and recovers its initial value, i.e., that observed for the pristine material. On the other hand, the Ni -O distance remains stable during the plateau, again supporting that Ni ions are not oxidized during the plateau. In discharge after a charge including the plateau (up to 4.8 V vs Li + /Li), the Ni -O distance increases and reaches that observed for the pristine material, again suggesting a reduction of Ni. Such redox reactions involving Ni ions during the /uniFB01 rst cycle agree with the analysis above considering the shift of XANES spectra. The Ni -M distance changes similarly, in parallel to the Ni -O distance, as shown in Figure 11b, decreasing during the charge before the plateau, being stable during the plateau, and increasing in discharge. In the second cycle, the Ni -O and Ni -M distances change continuously and reversibly as classically observed for normal layered oxides, as shown in Figure 11a -b.

Changes in the Co -O distance during the /uniFB01 rst cycle are shown in Figure 12a and compared with that of Co III -O in LiNi1/3 Co III 1/3 Mn1/3O2. These changes follow exactly the same trends as those for the Ni -O distance during the /uniFB01 rst and second cycles, although to a smaller extent since Co ions are oxidized from Co 3+ to Co 4+ , whereas Ni ions are oxidized from

Ni 2+ to Ni 4+ . The changes observed during the second cycle are expected and observed also for normal (non overlithiated) layered oxides.

As mentioned above, changes in the oxidation state of Mn ions during the /uniFB01 rst cycle were not clear from the analysis of XANES spectra at the Mn K-edge, and therefore, a complementary analysis of the Mn -O distances is required to support further our conclusions. The Mn -O distances determined during the /uniFB01 rst cycle are compared in Figure 13a

with Mn IV -O ones in LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn IV 1/3O2 and Li2MnO3 and with Mn ' 3.5+ ' -O ones in LiMn III,IV 2O4. The Mn -O distance decreases continuously from the beginning of the charge to high voltage and then reversibly increases in discharge, recovering its initial value. The total variation of the Mn -O distance over the potential window is small (0.01 Å). As shown in Figure 13a, similar changes occur during the second cycle, but again smaller than those observed for Ni and Co ions. As similar changes in the Mn -O distance were observed in LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2, for which Mn maintains at the tetravalent state all along the charge and discharge processes, 29 they could suggest modi /uniFB01 cation in the local environment around Mn. Indeed, in a layered structure made of edge-sharing octahedra, the size of a given octahedron is strongly related to (or constrained by) the size of the neighboring ones. In oxidation when cobalt and nickel ions are oxidized, there is a general lattice contraction (the a hex . parameter decreases) 10 leading to a small decrease in the Mn -O distances. The partial oxidation of oxygen at the end of the charge acts in the same way. The opposite e /uniFB00 ects occur in discharge, where the Mn -O recovers its initial value, but not a larger one, showing again that Mn is not reduced below the Mn 4+ oxidation state. We note that the Mn -M distance, in the reduced state, is slightly larger than in the pristine material (Figure 13b). This e /uniFB00 ect is not observed for Ni, whereas it is also observed for Co (Figure 12b). It supports again that the local second neighbors ' environment of Mn and Co, sitting in the same crystallographic site in the pristine material, is signi /uniFB01 cantly altered after the /uniFB01 rst charge. In contrast, as expected, this alteration does not occur for Ni.

4. Discussion. Electrochemical experiments have revealed that during the /uniFB01 rst charge 1.03 mol Li is deintercalated from the layered structure out of which 0.39 mol are compensated for by oxidation of Ni 2+ and Co 3+ to Ni 4+ and Co 4+ , respectively. 10,11 These oxidations are con /uniFB01 rmed by shifts to higher energy for XANES spectra recorded at the Ni and Co Kedges and by changes observed in the Ni -O and Co -O distances from EXAFS spectra recorded at the Ni and Co Kedges. It was proposed that the next 0.64 mol Li deintercalated during the /uniFB01 rst charge are compensated for by oxidation of oxide ions before their release as oxygen gas and then that Mn participates, with Ni and Co, as an additional redox center with its reduction to Mn 3+ in discharge and its oxidation to Mn 4+ in charge. 9 In fact, changes in the shape of the XANES spectra recorded at the Co and Mn K-edges during the plateau in the /uniFB01 rst charge indicate that alteration of the local structure around Co and Mn ions occurs, but do not indicate at all their further oxidation. Then, as expected, reduction of Ni and Co from Ni 4+ and Co 4+ to Ni 2+ and Co 3+ is con /uniFB01 rmed in discharge by the shift to lower energy of XANES spectra recorded at Ni and Co K-edges, but no reduction of Mn ions could be observed in discharge from the XANES spectra recorded at the Mn K-edge and from the Mn -O distances deduced from EXAFS spectra. The contribution of Mn to the redox processes appears, in fact, negligible during the /uniFB01 rst cycles. All the results deduced from these XAS data, from the local structures to the transition metals ' oxidation states, support thus again a participation of oxygen to the redox processes, such that oxide ions are oxidized during the plateau during the /uniFB01 rst charge and, for most of them, reversibly reduced in the next discharge. 10,11,26

## IV. CONCLUSIONS

Redox reactions of Li 1.20 Mn0.54 Co0.13 Ni0.13 O2 during the charge and discharge were characterized by operando XAS measurements. Changes in the oxidation state of each transition metal ion were followed from the shift of XANES spectra recorded at the Ni, Co, and Mn K-edges and from modi /uniFB01 cations in the metal -oxygen distances from EXAFS data. Ni and Co are oxidized in the /uniFB01 rst charge before the plateau and maintained at the Ni 4+ and Co 4+ oxidation states during the plateau. Mn is stable as Mn 4+ throughout the /uniFB01 rst charge. This entails that oxide ions are oxidized on the plateau with Li deintercalation. In discharge, Ni and Co are reduced and recover their initial states observed in the pristine material, whereas Mn is not reduced. Therefore, these results support again, as those reported in refs 10 and 11, that the oxygen loss model is not su /uniFB03 cient to explain the reactions occurring upon cycling of Li 1.20 Mn0.54 Co0.13 Ni0.13 O2, and thus, the involvement of oxygen in the reversible redox reactions, in addition to that of Ni and Co, is occurring.

Getting direct evidence of the participation of oxygen in the redox processes is not obvious, as probing the electronic state of oxygen is not straightforward by X-ray absorption, especially when the sample is recovered from a battery with electrolyte

degradation products (containing also oxygen) at its surface. Very recently, Tarascon and co-workers have studied the Li2Ru1 -ySn y O3 system as a lithium-rich layered oxide showing also an irreversible high voltage plateau during the /uniFB01 rst charge and an overcapacity versus the number of electrons that can be exchanged considering the transition metal ions only. 30 Interestingly, using X-band EPR measurements at room temperature and 4 K, they got direct evidence for the formation of oxidized oxygen species during the /uniFB01 rst charge and came, as we did, to the conclusion that overcapacity in the lithium-rich layered oxides is associated with reversible oxygen participation in the redox processes.
